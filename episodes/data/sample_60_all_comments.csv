They raise people to think that if they got hurt, they must have done something wrong and God had abandoned them to punish them. Everything they don't agree with, they insist that the devil is at fault. They don't like girls wearing shorts, so they say that the devil is at work instead of admitting that a girl might just like to wear shorts with no motives other than they thought it looked nice. They don't like makeup, so they say that the devil is at work and people who wear makeup are hiding their God given glory, which is a sin (if God really meant for only natural looks, why are we wearing clothes?

It's when you start wanting more and more and more and more is that when you start feel like you're missing out and you mentioned yourself in your comment the need to have proper guidance, if you have proper guidance you don't have to worry as much about the influence of TV because hopefully you're limiting how much TV and negative images your child watches.

That implicit bias influences how people see other people. That these damaging stereotypes have been engraved into the minds and cultures of billions of people across the world, right? Often, when Black women travel to Europe and Asia, local men approach them asking for their ""price,"" assuming these tourists are prostitutes because movies and music videos have portrayed Black women as hypersexual and promiscuous. When Black women try to get jobs in corporations, they cannot show any form of anger or frustration lest they be told they are too aggressive or mean.

Because even when the country really was racist, people still knew how to laugh at stereotypes of themselves, and to distinguish between light-hearted entertainment and (say) the kind of demonization exhibited by ""Birth of a Nation."" Most American blacks today -- like most Americans generally -- are ignorant of American history, more or less buy into the narrative that all of history before the 1970s or 80s was all-racism-all-the-time, have zero appreciation for the complexity of American race relations and the salutary developments that occured therein over the course of some two centuries -- the way BLM and leftist Democrats tell this history, the Civil Rights Act evidently spontaneously generated out of nowhere, and utterly inexplicably -- and so naturally the nuances of this history are lost.

To think of what the black community has had to endure this 2020, this tops the list. If we aren't dealing with systematic racism, we're dealing with unprecedented and often dehumanizing mockery and remarks about our beautiful untamed, gravity defiant curls and our unique rich dark chocolate skin. This has to change. I still refuse to believe that in this very day and age, a human being possessing accurate common sense finds it acceptable to dehumanize and degrade another human being. Is being black a crime? How will we raise the next generation of proud and rooted black children in a world where black is never good enough. Black hair and its beautiful knots and kinks is the one aspect of humanity that still remains original, these kinks are so powerful, not even scientce could define them, so why should we not be proud our curls? An ignorant society will never understand the amount of effort, time and ultimately respect that these beautiful kinks bring forth to black women and girls.

I conducted interviews with black women and collected their stories of natural hair bias, health problems caused by relaxers and stress, and memories of microaggressions and translated them into poetry. I then crafted those stories into a choreopoem entitled HairStory: Reclaiming Our Crown. We are holding auditions on February 7th, 2023. The show will be performed at Gamut Theatre in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on May 4th - 7th and we are doing two shows for school kids on the 9th and the 10th. This is such an important issue of inequality and prejudice. I wanted to, like you say, educate the public about it. My sword in this fight is poetry.

All employees responsible for publishing the offensive advertisement have been suspended. Clicks has accepted the resignation of the senior executive responsible. Cape Town, 8 September 2020 – Clicks is implementing a number of proactive measures to drive diversity and inclusivity, while helping develop and expand the local beauty market, in partnership with the government. Apart from suspending all employees involved in publishing the recent offensive advertisement, Clicks has accepted the resignation of the senior executive responsible. CEO Vikesh Ramsunder says all suspended employees will go through a fair and unbiased disciplinary hearing, overseen by an independent outside chairperson. In a key update, Ramsunder says Clicks will be delisting and removing all TRESemmé products from shelf with immediate effect and will be replacing the gap with locally sourced haircare brands, of which Clicks has an extensive range already. Furthermore, Clicks will be engaging with all suppliers to enforce their ethical code of conduct. In addition, Clicks has been involved in extensive discussions with the departments of labour and trade and industry over the past few days and will be working closely with them to help develop the local beauty market in South Africa. “We recognise this event has had a significant impact on our people and our customers and we have taken a decision to close our stores for a day on Wednesday 9 September. We will use this opportunity to engage directly with all our store staff across the county, to provide counselling and support. We will be supported by the ICAS Employee Health and Wellness Programme. We are prioritising our diversity and inclusion training programme for our head office staff. We will be reviewing its content, extending it wider and implementing with more urgency and focus. We are working with the SAPS to ensure the safety of our staff, customers and members of the public, and thank them for continuing to shop with us,"" Ramsunder says.","UCIuhzxwndy1DF0OfSn28q3Q","http://www.youtube.com/@nkatekoma",0,"","","videoinfo_OOGgY-r5gqg_2024_09_10-15_02_11_comments.csv","OOGgY-r5gqg"

I think that they could have used caucasian hair in one comparison- because I have seen plenty of their hair looking dry and damaged! In another comparison, because they are clearly aiming to be ‘inclusive’ and want the ‘black rand,’ use African hair. Don’t compare oranges to apples!! The trouble is, they lack context and keep their boardrooms as white as possible, yet still want to cater for those outside of the white demographic. It is utter DISRESPECT and CONDESCENSION!!!

I called it “RUVOL.” Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” Why am I so sure about this? Because I am an avid chess player myself. I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they could even play against opponents blindfolded. It is for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. Since Ruvol is yet “unpublished,” I am extra careful in fully disclosing how it is exactly played, lest it might be “plagiarized.” The “BEST PREVIEW” I can give, more than enough to appreciate how the game is played, is as follows: 1. Ruvol is almost somewhat played like chess. [I invented Ruvol primarily to give chess a direct “apple-to-apple” competition.] 2. Like chess, Ruvol is a board game for two players. 3. If the chess board is square in shape containing 64 squares in all, the Ruvol board is rectangular with more number of squares in it. 4. If each chess player has 16 pieces, each Ruvol player has same number of pieces as well. 5. If each type of chess piece moves in a distinct way, the Ruvol types of pieces move in distinct ways, too. 6. If to win the chess game requires tactical skills or strategic thinking, the more the Ruvol requires of it. 7. If the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is entirely different but far more exciting and challenging. In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world. These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe. At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$4 billion. Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale is US$40M. I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL. For the reason that I don’t have enough resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it “wiser” to simply sell my copyright. If you are interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER—[the copyright goes to the highest bidder]. My email address is: rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com. Thanks and God bless.

If anybody thinks Unilever feels anything for you, you got another thing coming.You suspend or fire the staff responsible for uploading this, but what is the EFF doing to the people responsible for creating the add? To the EFF, you spend so much energy on protesting, looting and damaging Clicks stores and property, why not take that pent up energy, go to Letuli House and demand the millions or is it billions of rands lost by our government? Again, ppl are selective in what they deem correct. Almost seems as if they are ""paid"" to do certain things. If any of you think the eff are in your corner, you got another thing coming. This for the EFF and any politcal party is a way of gaining public favor, nothing more. It it not the dream of most woman to have long flowing straight hair? Look at this link, check out the image, and you will see, that even Julius Malema appreciates long straight hair. https://www.bona.co.za/mantwa-and-julius-malema-celebrate-their-third-wedding-anniversary/ Take a 30 minute walk through any African city, and you will see how many ""black"" woman want long flowing straight hair. So they would rather adorn themselves with someone elses long straight black hair by wearing a weave, than buying a product that can offers to get there own hair straight and shiny LOL. Comon man ppl, get off your high horse, there are more pressing matters to attend to. The EFF wants all Clicks stores to close for so many days, what happens after that? Can anybody tell me what is going to happen after Clicks closes its doors for a few days? Will that make things better again?

All I see is political agenda to divide people and the media is making a huge success of that.","UCL5nwPVePPyHSkzUN1HOrVw","http://www.youtube.com/@raymondglad5593",1,"UgyXPRl6wmi0LrnKUip4AaABAg","@raymondglad5593","videoinfo_PG0pYsaIh6s_2024_09_10-14_59_17_comments.csv","PG0pYsaIh6s"

"UgwKM55lcgA4jQQE6th4AaABAg.9DJhdmvlhJ99DLoCLaffZI",NA,2,"2020-09-08 14:57:27","","First. Racism is obviously a problem and as a united S.A. we should always stand against it. White, black, coloured, indian, asian... We all experience racism towards us in different ways (expecially in SA) and it is good when we stand together against it. Second. When the photo was originally made. I can promise you it was innocent. (Go look at the advert, most people don't even know what the advert looks like) Clicks is a level 2 BEE company. This means that almost everyone who works there is black. In fact, it was revealed that the marketing team who made the photo was multiracial and the manager who approved it was of coloured decent. There is no doubt in my mind that this photo was never intended to be racist. So why are people freaking out about it? 2 reasons: First we must understand the underlying psychological nature of racism. It is like a ""plant"" that grows within peoples minds. Whenever arguments occur (like the one about clicks) people are forced to focus on race & think of racial issues. They are forced to choose sides & found their believes in the various narratives placed around them in order to reach closure. This process inevitably waters the ""plant"" of racism within us, allowing racism to spread and grow. In other words, by making a ""fuss"" over what was inherently a innocent advert. Everyone is now forced to contemplate the advert in a racial way. And they are now convinced the advert was a racial attack and they feel hurt. It is like when a young daughter wants to always sit on her fathers lap. It is sweet and innocent until somebody makes a digusting/inappropriate comment. Suddenly the whole room is forced to feel uncomfortable, and we are forced to look at a innocent act in a dark way. So where am I getting at? Well... The point that I want to reach is that nobody would've even bothered to consider the advert as a racial attack, if people were not so racially obsessed in the first place. This psychological phenomena is unfortunately fuelled by the various politcal narratives parties like the ANC, EFF, FV+ and recently the DA always use to gather voters. And now we reach the second reason... The EFF has hijacked the narrative to do some good old fashioned sheep farming. The EFF gathers the majority of its voters (the sheep) by enflaming and prodding feelings of race and identity in order to manipulate them. Once the EFF has sufficiently made people upset enough. The EFF provides a narrative that gives false closure (remember what I wrote above) and promotes the political agenda that makes them look good. It will always feed a narrative along the lines of: ""There is a oppressor (usually whites but sometimes indians or asians) who seeks to harm and steal from the innocent & oppressed (in this case often black people). All others (ANC, DA, corporations, etc) are in league with the oppressors & are traitors and cannot be trusted. Only we can be trusted ( the EFF). You can only vote for us if you want justice."" The above example is a classic manipulation strategy that has been used by almost all dictators in the past to wrestle for power. In fact. It is exactly what hitler did to come into power. Hitler had a narrative like this: ""There is a oppressor (Jews, non-arians, communists) who seeks to harm and steal from the innocent & oppressed (in this case the true german people, the arians). All others (politcal parties, countries, corporations, etc) are in league with the oppressors & are traitors and cannot be trusted. Only we can be trusted ( the nazis). You can only vote for us if you want justice."" Malema does step for step what every dictator of the past has done for power. But he does not care about the people... The EFF was silent and showed poor leadership in these past times with corona virus, the vbs money they stole, corruption, and the well justified protests by coloured people on their political treatment. And now that the 2021 elections are around the corner, they do the same classic sheep farming they have done since the party was founded. So this is the second reason people are upset. They are being manipulated by a cunt in a red hat for some cheap and easy votes","UCew7-yMLtgyNnwIA9Sw3FNA","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCew7-yMLtgyNnwIA9Sw3FNA",1,"UgwKM55lcgA4jQQE6th4AaABAg","@roshinishunmagum7584","videoinfo_PG0pYsaIh6s_2024_09_10-14_59_17_comments.csv","PG0pYsaIh6s"

Fact is predominantly black women suffers with dry damaged hair, to a lesser extend white woman as well. With both white and black woman you will also find good healthy hair. The advert focused on different hair types found on different ethnic types. They offer a solution for different types of problems. That’s the facts. Both white and black woman do a lot of damage to their hair trying to achieve a specific style or color. White woman by dying their hair and black woman with products such as relaxers etc. Why keeping the EFF aside now? Julius took the matter in his own hands using it as a political tool for all the wrong reasons. Did he or any EFF member or supporter look at the long term implications of the action? If Clicks has to close down who will suffer the most? The majority of the workforce is non white people! So is this in anybody’s good interest? So people like me have a long way to go in this country? Nope, I think you got it all wrong. If an advert of any kind on any platform cause any form of sorrow or injustice by implication the affected person(s) can go to the advertising board and lay a formal complain. That is what they are therefore. This is not even a place or a platform for any political party to get involved with.

I do not believe for a second the intent was racism, even Clicks mixed race marketing team were ok with the advert, a huge error on their part, but not a racist one. Tresemme do not even cater for African hair (which we have to agree on, is nothing like white hair, it's beautiful, and what I call ""angel"" hair), so their attempt to include Africans to be inclusive, to avoid being racist, was an absolute flop. As I mentioned in my above comment, they really should have used an Indian or coloured woman's hair for their ""normal"" shampoo. I am not saying the advert is ok, as they REALLY should have realised how offensive it could be, but I do not think it deserved the reaction it received, nor do I think their marketing team / head of should be fired. Clicks apologised, am sure the advert was removed, they will no longer even be stocking and selling Tresemme products. Trashing and looting stores, intimidating staff and shoppers, is unacceptable behaviour, far worse than the ridiculous advert. Why not instead concentrate on the REAL issues happening in South Africa? The millions stolen, the children and women being raped and murdered, farmer attacks (not just white, many African farmers are being attacked too), homelessness, people starving, These are REAL issues to deal with. I would have far more respect for EFF if they chose to tackle these issues that desperately need sorting.","UCR9Qn3FX8BbDZX19jXcwg4Q","http://www.youtube.com/@carmabee4600",1,"Ugz6lNWK5oE9oRNuUGN4AaABAg","@oratuwe8114","videoinfo_PG0pYsaIh6s_2024_09_10-14_59_17_comments.csv","PG0pYsaIh6s"

Our hair means a lot to and it has a lot history. During colonization and slavery black people were told to cut their hair or cover it up, we were told our hair was ugly and dirty. Then years later when relaxers were invented black people were told to relax their hair because straight hair is beautiful and coily, curly or kinky hair is ugly. To some people we are overreacting and being irrational, but if anyone had to go through the type of oppression that we went through and still going through, no one would be saying what they are saying. We are usually disrespectful and humiliated. Nobody knows the pain black people go through, having to love a world that deosnt love you back, having to live our lives in fear because we are afraid of judgment, having to wake up in a world where no one has respect for you, constantly deal with racial discrimination, having being constantly told that you are not beautiful, having to feel like you are not human and not knowing where you belong. We have been through so much just to be silent. Black people will no longer continue to live in fear or silence. I get where you are coming from, maybe it was not meant to be offensive but how are black people expected to react after being through all this pain. We are told colonization is over but we continue to live with the after effects. There is colorism, some black people are still living in poverty due to the lack of education or lack of opportunities. A lot black people were used to relaxing their hair now that we are realizing that our hair is beautiful, some people want to portray our hair as damaged, that is unacceptable, we cannot accept being disrespected anymore. It is easy for you to say it wasn't meant to be offensive because you are not Black. No one has ever victimized, even a portion of what we go through or what we have been through. EFF is angry about all the things white people have done to us, one big example is the killing of 10 million people by the cruel king Leopold, or the police brutality in the US. This is the uprisings of Black people and we are saying NO MORE to all of this bullshit. I respect your opinion but there's always an origin to everything, you can never find a tree without roots.","UCurEX0jDwKXAx5_BGlx9g4A","http://www.youtube.com/@ketsiamukadi4299",1,"UgzUHTsJgig1d5MSvpJ4AaABAg","@frederikmare9002","videoinfo_PG0pYsaIh6s_2024_09_10-14_59_17_comments.csv","PG0pYsaIh6s"

We living in tough and very sensitive times of which we have to tip toe around conversations, topics, race and etc. In my opinion they were to make the AD do comparisons of say healthy And Unhealthy hair of all races that makes South Africa united. So I can see how some will have looked at it and say but why is it that in two different examples the same person has sort of bad hair. But it’s good to have a healthy and progressing dialogue while also teaching people to be mindful. Maybe the panel at clicks who are black has good hair and it’s maybe they didn’t see how it might offend majority of people as it was not a uniting factor having such an AD but for the consumer it would make sense.

You speculate my opinions on the matter to be creating racist issues. No trading store would ever want to anger their customers.

At least clicks realized this. Even though our country's passed may make you uncomfortable take it into consideration on this matter. Race relations on TV requires cultural sensitivity and is not an inconvenience nor is it insignificant. This is what happens when we choose perspectives of ignorance, we end up with content that should not have been made and posted causing feelings of anger. Which was taken advantage of by the EFF. Why do you think so many absurd and wrongful farm murders are happening? Because choosing certain ""perspectives"" to dismiss our country's history/reality makes people feel wronged and resentful.

Look now how hash is EFF reacting to this Clicks advert and who are the people who are going to suffer here? BLACK PEOPLE!! I believe one of the reasons for not voting for them is because EFF will make us to go to Zimbabwe- they will turn this country in a state Zimbabwe is right now, just like Mugabe did. He took the whites out of Zimbabwe and brought the country 's economy to it's knees, when he was living a lavish lifestyle with his family the poor Zimbabweans had to cross borders for a piece of bread. We cannot deny the fact that a white man is still having full control of this country- economy. So imagine what if we vote them in what will happen to the majority of South African aka poor people . I wish that EFf can push empowering of a black young south Africans first. When a young black south Africans are economically empowered we can then vote for them knowing that we have nothing to lose should they ( EFF) take over governance in this nation.

Three, you should have ensured that you have enough guards protecting your stores. Four, I will never work for you, because your Health and Safety procedures lack, and while you are on the accepting of resignations, accept the employee who is in charge of your health and safety’s resignation as well.

My question is why are we not perhaps discussing: The fact that Domestic Violence is on the rise- Just earlier today a woman was shot in a police station by her husband. The fact that we are in a Global Pandemic- Has everybody just forgotten about the lives that have been lost during this period of time. The fact that Child Trafficking has increased exponentially in the last short while. #SaveOur Children. The fact that a Down syndrome child was shot dead by our police- There has been no justice. The fact that we have a possible serial killer in Kwazulu Natal murdering women. The fact that we are loadsheading again and again and again… The fact that Eastern Cape has no water because the government has stolen money for the pipework, chemical etc Then blame it on a drought when the dams are full of water. The fact that farmers are dying- what are we going to eat guys? The fact that most of us are either scared of the Police or ready to pay a bribe when they come knocking. What is important- We hold nobody accountable anymore. Politicians just run around carrying on and then we suffer. Is anybody actually going to tackle corruption or are we just swopping one type of corruption for another? Lottering and destroying Clicks- what happens to our economy if they decide to close doors and take away their business? Soon it will be election time again the options are pointless. EFF destroying everything in the name of justice ANC stealing everything in the name of authority DA running circles around themselves never actually able to do anything This country is honestly in trouble when there is no party worth voting for who actually cares about the citzens, we all will fall down.

I'll explain why... 1. People see the pictures featuring black women that are inscribed as dry and dull. These are legitimate issues that women face with their hair so Clicks is highlighting that problem and saying ""we have a product that will fix that"". 2. They see the white woman with hair described as fine and flat. Thinking this is a good thing when it is not... women do not like fine and flat hair. ""fine"" is actually thin hair. Notice how all adverts of hair products for women feature them with a lot of volume in their hair? That's what women like. Clicks is again saying you have flat and fine hair? ""We have a product that can fix that"". 3. They see the picture with the white woman with the description ""normal hair"" the issue here is that the woman is white and there is no black woman as an equivalent there. So people put two and two together and think this advert is saying the hair of white women is normal while the hair of black women is abnormal. That is not at all what the advert was saying but people have jumped to conclusions... knee jerk reactions from outrage culture has resulted in toxicity, divisiveness and ultimately violence... The solution here was Clicks had two options it could have taken to avoid this whole ""catastrophy"". 1. Use a black model for the ""normal hair"" picture. 2. Have a black model alongside the white model in the ""normal hair"" picture. If Clicks had done either of those two things none of this would have happened... But unfortunately South Africans are too fragile to think critically and analyze things before jumping to conclusions and crying racism where there actually isn't racism... But hey what I do know I'm just some white guy that doesn't trash pharmacies because of an advert...","UC9eFiW4DNAPd-YNqxCyUe4g","http://www.youtube.com/@springbok8876",0,"","","videoinfo_rSojJTYFmoI_2024_09_10-14_58_10_comments.csv","rSojJTYFmoI"

I am the get away driver for a crew of bank robbers and in the course of the robbery, let's say a security guard shoots and kills an innocent customer, or lets stretch it a bit further, another crew walks in and joins the robbery and one of them kills an innocent customer. Now as far as I know even though I was sitting outside in the get away vehicle I can and will be charged with murder as if i had pulled the trigger myself. The mere fact that my participation enabled all of this to happen makes me guilty right, or is South Africa different? The EFF claim they are not responsible for the damage and that it was done by ""agent provocateurs"" or even by the victim themselves and therefore they cannot be held responsible. The way I see it, had they not organised, participated and instructed their members to ""ATTACK!"" then there would have been no opportunity for ""agent provocateurs"" or the victim themselves to cause damage. Surely as in my analogy the EFF is responsible and can be held to account for everything that took place or am i just totally ignorant on how the law works? Yes I know in South Africa there is no such thing as law and it only applies to select individuals.","UCd40NA4JdV3TBYXWmySFgfw","http://www.youtube.com/@janrdoh",0,"","","videoinfo_rSojJTYFmoI_2024_09_10-14_58_10_comments.csv","rSojJTYFmoI"

And where we are supposed to reason and debate our views, and where we should respect freedom of speech and opinion. And also where we do not incite violence against one another.

You will have to be a twenty four / seven basement dwelling neanderthal oblivious to what is out there in the real world if you fail to acknowledge that racism is still very much alive today despite the fact that ""apartheid"" was abolished 26 years ago.

Answer me this, would you want to have the geulty ones legally punished for their acts. Find the roots of the problem and everyone involved in the makings to be individually punished. OR would go out and destroy property to try and scare them? Geuss what, the guilty ones' have enough money to start over when clicks fall.

So next time before jumping on the racist waggon and give us whites all the blame, try to see what YOU could have done different to BUILD and not destroy.

You and I both know that this is not true but as a politician you have to capture the masses' interest and capitalise on that even if it means misleading people. The purpose here is to earn votes and DA's failure to draft a manifesto which resonates with the majority will cost it a shit-load of votes. When this happens you are allowing EFF which is the 3rd biggest political party in the country to replace DA as an opposition party. The big question is who is worth voting for?

Doesn't seem like this stunt has gone over well though because now the EFF is claiming that the vandalism was done by a third force and they have nothing to do with it. I think our image of the EFF as being canny manipulators is a bit exaggerated by the fact that they came up during Zuma's administration, when getting people to side with you simply by opposing Zuma was so easy that even the DA could do it. They are now in a bind because they don't have a hell of a lot to offer. Apart from ""the land,"" which the ANC is doing anyway, their only unique policy positions this year are advocacy for extending level 5 lockdown for a year (highly unpopular), and having open borders to the rest of Africa (highly unpopular). Their supporters seem to be on the one hand desperate people ignorant of their policies, and on the other hand overeducated ideologically possessed twits. I'm far from saying that they are not a threat, I was sounding the warning bells years ago when most people were still laughing. But it doesn't seem like the voters they are contending for could be contested by any party with reasonable or practical proposals. The sole exception of a good EFF policy being decentralization via the use of SEZs, which is a good idea that's been floating around in the South African urban planning literature since the 1970s at least.","UCqT4YpYn5OyUkqIi9O68Gow","http://www.youtube.com/@wolfieinu",1,"UgyFHUOt6lyrpGQUY0p4AaABAg","@chriswessels6754","videoinfo_rSojJTYFmoI_2024_09_10-14_58_10_comments.csv","rSojJTYFmoI"

Similarly, as I recall, the ad showed light-haired white women's hair as being flat and thin, which is a concern for them. I fail to see how that's racist. Should whites of Northern/Germanic extraction be destroying Clicks stores because it's discriminatory against them to portray blonde hair as thin and flat, whereas Mediterranean hair is thicker and with more body? It's ridiculous. We know from reality what different kinds of hair look like. The irony is that people will destroy a shop one day for saying their hair is frizzy, and then the next day they will go buy hair straightener.

Lots of Indian women of older generation had beautiful glowy skin because of Castor oil use over the years. Nowadays it is so underated and underreviewed. If you continuing over weeks and months your skin will be near flawless. I have ditched all my expensive high end products for old time castor oil for my skin. My cleanser is Dove sensitive skin bar soap and castor oil as a moisturizer at night. During the day I use thin layer of castor oil and tea tree oil and apply 50+ Sunscreen. My skin is so much better now eversince I switched from using chemical loaded products from the time of Pandemic lockdowns. Another advantage is saving so much money from buying expensive chemical laden products. I get so much compliments for my skin now. Another factor to note is your diet has a big factor as well. Lots of water and vegatables in your diet will be an added bonus for your glowing skin.

Malema needs to be careful, he could be the next political leader in SA that gets shot, it's a common thing with communists (or fascists) to be taken down. He only has 3-6% of votes. The media makes it look like he is important but all he does is steal from supporters to pay for crimes and big houses. Unfortunately people in South Africa don't understand what propaganda is. So when they decide have balls (which the EFF don't) they are always in groups and are afraid to be alone because they have few supporters. What do they think is going to happen at the end of all this? In South Africa 90% of the land is unoccupied, but instead of giving them the land they want to take what has already been built and bought, they don't create they destroy and steal and create imaginary problems. Malema owns multiple houses, cars etc but he doesn't buy any of his supporters houses or anything. Instead of arguing with the government (ANC) he needs another enemy like the Nazi's did with Jews. In this case it is white South Afrricans. Dear foreigners there is NO land issue. Just racism and politics. Our country is large and bountiful there is plenty of land to take. They just want to take from those who have bought land from the government (ANC) because they think all white people stole land. This is a falsehood as you have to buy it from the government. There is so much land but they refuse to work on it, instead they want to take what has already been built where they don't have to work. There are countless farms which were ""given""back that have failed miserably because they don't understand this difference between commercial farming and subsistence farming. Let me ask you this EFF members, if someone took your land that you bought from the government (ANC) and you had to give it up, would you leave it in pristine condition? Or would you destroy it all since they are taking it with no compensation. Don't be stupid farmers will pour black oil on their fields to get you back, then you will have useless land. Stop biting the hand that feeds you and go claim unoccupied land were you won't cause problems and you can contribute back into society instead of inciting violence, stealing, being racist and generally just causing a unhappy atmosphere for your children.","UCkqd2VZONDE3ZB_J7gtJekw","http://www.youtube.com/@galgamekthegreatlord4823",0,"","","videoinfo_vXyam3MFMqw_2024_09_12-09_58_34_comments.csv","vXyam3MFMqw"

Protesting all day instead of attending their studies or going to work to fix our broken economy. Critical Race Theory is a huge scam!","UCuV-xvURD1ZM8HHfUpdObYw","http://www.youtube.com/@TheNotsoignorant",0,"","","videoinfo_vXyam3MFMqw_2024_09_12-09_58_34_comments.csv","vXyam3MFMqw"

"UgwgoAw4JnBbdHRO-7F4AaABAg",1,0,"2020-09-08 00:18:14","@ronb6022","I saw the ad. Either the EFF is doing this for political gain and playing dumb or they do not understand what the ad is saying. NO WHITE WOMAN WANTS FINE FLAT HAIR. Fine here means thin in texture. It was comparing a white woman's normal hair with the problem of fine flat hair that some white women have and NOT comparing it to the hair of black woman. The ad was saying the exact same thing about white problem lack-luster hair as it was saying about black hair IF there is a problem. The white woman's hair looks horrible in the flat fine hair pic. NOT NICE FROM A WHITE POINT OF VEIW!! There was no racism in it at all, the aim was to be INCLUSIVE. What the ad was saying - no matter the problem, the product will fix it. In the case of the white woman it will give the hair body and fullness and strengthen it not to have such a fine texture and help it to look normal again. The EFF are making a laughing stock of themselves in the eyes of the world who understand the context. But they want to make political gain from it because they know their voters might not understand the context. They did not bother to check the meaning from a first language English point of view or if they did they are ignoring it for their own motives. The company that makes that hair product - TRESemmé has its headquarters in New York. The ad was most likely made there for first-language English speakers and sent all over the world as an international campaign.They know that fine flat hair will be understood as BAD by first-language English speakers. They did not realize it will be misunderstood in other countries where English was not the first language. It was an innocent oversight and no racism was intended. It was actually meant to be inclusive and accommodating of different races - the very opposite of what it is being accused of - simply because of ignorance of how English is used. Millions of people understand it the correct way where English is their first language. They did not realise that in Africa fine and flat could be understood as complimentary and praiseworthy while in fact it is speaking about a hair problem white woman want to find a solution for. So this is a language issue that the EFF are exploiting for their own gains pretending it is a racial issue. I hope South Africans that have fallen for this trick will realize they are being played as puppets by the EFF leaders. If they really misunderstood the English language, and did no checks, who could ever trust them to guide South Africa on the international stage.","UCxC23Y6vzDmxpTV55jDDrKg","http://www.youtube.com/@ronb6022",0,"","","videoinfo_ZndDor2DQrk_2024_09_12-10_18_23_comments.csv","ZndDor2DQrk"
