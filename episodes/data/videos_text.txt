Local hair product manufacturers want government and retailers to support them to get and keep their merchandise on shelves. The call comes after outrage at Clicks for promoting a racially offensive TRESemmé ad. The retailer says it will now use that shelf space for local brands. Aviwe Mtila is following this story. #DStv403
"Clicks has committed to spend more money with small businesses, and support local beauty and hair brands. The beleaguered retailer met with Small Business Development Minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni after the offensive advert uproar. Earlier this week, the minister rejected Clicks' apology. Courtesy #DStv403"
The EFF has continued its protest against Clicks' hair advertisement that they deemed to be racist. This Clicks is in Stellenbosch's Eikestad Mall. Video: Supplied.

"The recent uproar around Clicks Beauty store publishing a hair ad that is said to be Racist has actually become a catalyst to consciousness across the collective.As a black woman who embraces natural hair,i see no reason to be emotional and attribute it to racism..We taught industries how to treat us..we need to switch around our mentality and focus on loving and accepting ourselves as the beautiful people we are.It is not about race..Duality is man made.LET US BE THE CHANGE😍 #selflove #consciousness #Black #EFF #Naturalhair"

"Clicks Racist Hair Advert vs EFF. | The recent Clicks Hair Ad has caused consternation across the black community. So far the issue has split comment sections. Others not seeing it offensive at all. EFF's statement is being questioned. ( Their demand is basically to see numbers of employees that identify as Black / African in executive and corporate levels. Please look up campaigns like ' Pull Up or Shut Up' if that request still confuses you.) (Personally), I will not support a company that does not have enough brainpower to see that this is offensive.

In this video you see me try them out. This video is not sponsored and my opinion on these products it's completely true. Don't forget to Subscribe to my channel. Let me know if you would try these products. ALL three of these were R65 each at Clicks. The curl definer is amazing. My curls were instantly defined and that's never happened to me. So you will be seeing more hairstyles with that Gel. The mask, my scalp loved every second in that mask and my hair is till Moisturises until now. It honestly felt natural like I made my own mask. The butter is really thick but it stayed in my hair for days. It was hard to shake off the whiteness for like 24hours. It took like 7 hours for my hair to dry. I have a heavy hand 😂😂I use alot of product. Don't be like me.

"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) called upon their members to shut down all 880 Clicks stores nationwide from Monday the 7th of September to Friday the 11th of September. On the 4th of September Clicks published an advertisement on their website which depicted the hair of a black woman as “dry, damaged, frizzy and dull” against that of a white woman which is described as “colour, treated, fine flat and normal” hair. This discriminatory connotation caused outrage amongst South Africans who turned to social media to express themselves. Cat White Media followed this story at Clicks in Jeffrey’s Bay.

"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), South Africa’s third largest political party, today continued with their mass protests to close the stores of health and beauty retailer Clicks, across South Africa. Clicks is one of the largest retail chain brands in South Africa. The company came under from the EFF and on social media after an advertisement on their website depicted natural hair as “dry and damaged” while the hair of a white woman was depicted as “fine and normal”. Clicks was today granted a high court interdict prohibiting the EFF from disrupting their business operations or intimidating their staff. Despite the interdict, the EFF continued with the closure of stores. Clicks has announced that a senior executive responsible for placing the images has resigned and junior staff involved have been suspended. The company has also removed all Tresseme products from its shelves and made a decision to expand its range of natural hair products."

Members of the EFF gathered at various Clicks stores this morning to shut down the outlets following a controversial advert. Clicks Group CEO Vikesh Ramsunder had issued an apology after concern was raised about the advert. Meanwhile the High Court has reportedly dismissed the retailer’s application to stop EFF protests.
Let's call racism what it is. It is wrong and let's make things right for the future generation.

"Members of the EFF Chris Hani region, led by the party's provincial chairman Yazini Thetyana closed down the two cosmetics Clicks stores in Komani in retaliation of a ""racist"" advert that was posted on their website last week. The advert has since been taken down and an apology issued. Full story in The Rep"
"WHILE THE EFF warned that it would keep Clicks stores closed until Friday, the retailer said it had decided to close all branches today to engage with staff, and then hoped to reopen. The closure of hundreds of stores in the pharmaceutical, health and beauty chain for a second consecutive day followed an outcry over the publication of a controversial advert for hair product TRESemmé. Members of the EFF were dispatched to the stores as part of a national protest against the advert in which black women’s hair was described as “dry and damaged” while white women’s hair was represented as flat and fine."

"The two women, among a group of 18, who took Unilever and Clicks to the Equality Court over a TRESemmé shampoo advert, say they felt disrespected by the commercial. They gave evidence to the human rights commission inquiry into racism and discrimination in the advertising industry. Newzroom Afrika's Malungelo Booi reports. Tune into Newzroom Afrika, DSTV channel 405 for more details."
"Despite the apology by healthcare group Clicks and the retraction of a print advertisement that created a national outcry, there's still a lot of anger over what many view as the reinforcement of a narrative that portrays white as better than black. The advertisement showed two sets of images identifying black hair as dry and damaged, as well as frizzy and dull, and white hair as fine and flat on one image, and normal on the other. People pointed out on social media that this is not the first time the company has used prejudicial advertisements which are insulting to black communities. The EFF has also weighed in and issued a call for Clicks to close all its stores. Joining us now to discuss this are Brightness Mangolothi, Director at Litmus Consultancy, and Solly Moeng, Brand Reputation Management Advisor and CEO of DonValley.

"Retailer, Clicks has closed all its stores today and will reopen them tomorrow following EFF's protests over an online hair advert that denigrated black people. Nonkululeko Gobodo, an independent, non-executive director at the Clicks Group, says the controversial hair advert is both unacceptable and inexcusable. The online advert denigrated the hair of black people, portraying white hair as normal. Amid protests by the EFF, the lifestyle and health retailer has closed all stores today and will re-open them tomorrow in order to offer counselling services to staff. Gobodo says she has highlighted the issue with Clicks management asking it to review the processes used to approve the advert. She also says racism and prejudice against women are crimes, and the country cannot move forward unless these are immediately addressed in society and business.

"The Mammy, Jezebel and Sapphire are three stereotypes of Black women that have been around in Western culture for centuries. These simplistic depictions are rooted in the slave trade and live on today. Faced with an entertainment industry that is dominated by men - mostly white - Black women have gone online to tell their stories. And all the clicks and likes mean that media executives are finally starting to take notice. The Listening Post's Johanna Hoes reports on the media's stereotyping of Black women and the push for change in an industry where diversity has been too long in coming.
