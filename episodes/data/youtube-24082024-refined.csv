I was product shopping and I bought these products. In this video you see me try them out. This video is not sponsored and my opinion on these products it's completely true. Don't forget to Subscribe to my channel. Let me know if you would try these products. ALL three of these were R65 each at Clicks. The curl definer is amazing. My curls were instantly defined and that's never happened to me. So you will be seeing more hairstyles with that Gel. The mask, my scalp loved every second in that mask and my hair is till Moisturises until now. It honestly felt natural like I made my own mask. The butter is really thick but it stayed in my hair for days. It was hard to shake off the whiteness for like 24hours. It took like 7 hours for my hair to dry. I have a heavy hand 😂😂I use alot of product. Don't be like me.
