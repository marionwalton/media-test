Nonkululeko Gobodo, an independent, non-executive director at the Clicks Group, says the controversial hair advert is both unacceptable and inexcusable. The online advert denigrated the hair of black people, portraying white hair as normal. Amid protests by the EFF, the lifestyle and health retailer has closed all stores today and will re-open them tomorrow in order to offer counselling services to staff. Gobodo says she has highlighted the issue with Clicks management asking it to review the processes used to approve the advert. She also says racism and prejudice against women are crimes, and the country cannot move forward unless these are immediately addressed in society and business.

These simplistic depictions are rooted in the slave trade and live on today. Faced with an entertainment industry that is dominated by men - mostly white - Black women have gone online to tell their stories. And all the clicks and likes mean that media executives are finally starting to take notice. The Listening Post's Johanna Hoes reports on the media's stereotyping of Black women and the push for change in an industry where diversity has been too long in coming.
