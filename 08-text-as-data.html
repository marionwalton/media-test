<hr class="half-width"><p>Computational linguistics and Corpus Linguistics are two related
areas of study in linguistics. Both of these areas provide approaches
which media scholars can use when analysing textual data in media
texts.</p>
<p>Computational linguistics is a broad inter-disciplinary area of study
where software and algorithms are developed to analyse and synthesise
language and speech for applications such as machine translation, speech
recognition, machine learning and deep learning (“AI”). Corpus
linguistics has developed methods to study trends and patterns in
language use by analysing large collections of electronically stored,
naturally occurring texts. Both of these areas are related to Natural
Language Processing (NLP) which is a subfield of computer science.</p>
<p>While Computational Linguistics has a strongly quantitative focus,
Corpus Linguistics often includes qualitative analysis (such as
examining concordance lines). Corpus linguistics involves much
qualitative work interpreting text, and so can be used to extend the
scope of traditional media studies approaches to linguistic discourse
such as Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA).</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>A <em>corpus</em> is a set of documents which stores large quantities
of real-life text. The plural form of the word is <em>corpora</em>.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="using-a-document-term-matrix">Using a Document-Term Matrix<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-a-document-term-matrix"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Computers work by using numbers, and so corpora are analysed by
generating a numerical representations of text.</p>
<p>A popular representation of text in CL is the <em>Document-Term
Matrix</em> or <em>DTM</em> (also known as Term-Document Matrix (TDM) or
Document-Feature Matrix (DTM). A DTM represents a corpus as a large
table (known as a matrix).</p>
<p>We will study a small example of a document-term matrix, using this
famous quotation from Nelson Mandela’s 1964 speech during the Rivonia
Trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which
all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.
It is an idea for which I hope to live for and to see realized. But, my
Lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to
die.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>quanteda</strong> the function to create a DTM is
<code>dfm()</code>, as it can be used for textual features other than
individual words or tokens (e.g. emojis or punctuation marks).</p>
<p>Each document has a separate row, each word has a separate column,
and each cell has a number showing how often a particular word appears
in a particular document.</p>
<p>We start by creating a list of the individual words in the sentences,
which in <strong>quanteda</strong> uses the <code>tokens()</code>
function. Our second step is to convert these words into a DTM using
<code>dfm()</code>. For the purposes of this example, we will treat each
sentence as a separate “text”.</p>

<p>The example matrix above shows the losses and the gains when we
represent the closing sentences of Mandela’s four hour long speech from
the dock as a DTM.</p>
<p>We lose the original word order of the conclusion to the speech, its
poetic use of repetition and the impact of the final statement.</p>
<p>At the same time, we gain other insights. Since we represent the
speech in a numeric matrix format Mandela’s linguistic choices are
quantified and we can see certain lexical patterns. This draws attention
to some rhetorical strategies, such as the repetition of the first
person pronoun “I” and the repeated words “ideal” and “live”, which lead
up to the shock of the final emphatic “die”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by converting the whole speech into the quantitative DTM
format, we can more easily use computational methods to compare
Mandela’s 1964 speech to other famous speeches, such as his speech in
1994, or to speeches made by other political leaders and statesmen.</p>
<p>Now we will load the full text of the speech from a collection of
speeches <code>speeches.tsv</code> to investigate these linguistic
patterns.</p>

<p>Making sense of such frequencies requires us to understand an
important concept in computational analysis of text, namely

<h1 id="using-word-frequencies-to-analyse-text">Using Word Frequencies to Analyse Text<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-word-frequencies-to-analyse-text"></a></h1>
<p>Frequency is a key concept underpinning the analysis of text and
corpora. As a purely quantitative measure, media researchers need to use
word frequencies with a sensitivity to the word-distribution patterns in
human languages, and the importance of context for meaning</p>
<p>Word frequency lists are an important starting point and can help
direct an investigation. We combine them with measures of dispersion,
which are used to reveal trends across texts. For example, certain
linguistic patterns may occur more often at the beginning or ends of
texts.</p>
<p>At the same time, frequencies can be reductive and generalising. If
we’re interested in meaning it’s important not to oversimplify, and
focusing only on word distributions can obscure more interesting
interpretations of a text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="why-is-frequency-important">Why is frequency important?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-is-frequency-important"></a></h1>
<p>Language is not a random affair - it is <em>rule based</em>. Words
are likely to occur predictably in relationship to other words.</p>
<p>At the same time, human beings use language creatively and people can
make many choices about how they want to use language. Language has
<em>rule-generating</em> qualities which is why it changes over time and
varies depending on the context where it is used.</p>

<h1 id="the-relationship-between-frequency-and-ideology">The relationship between frequency and ideology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-relationship-between-frequency-and-ideology"></a></h1>
<p>Media studies builds on the insights of discourse analysis and corpus
linguistics, which have sensitised researchers to the ideological
implications of the words people choose to use.</p>

<p>The chart shows us that the most commonly used words in the speech as
a whole are similar to the common English words we saw repeated in the
final sentences.These words are known as grammatical or function words
and are the most commonly used in a language. They seldom change over
short periods of time.</p>
<p>For this reason, grammatical and function words are on lists of words
to be excluded from frequency counts. These lists are known as “stop
words”</p>

(“African”, “ANC”, “Africans”, “people”, “political”, “umkhonto”,
“Africa”, “white”, “South”,“violence”,
“government”,“policy”,“against”,“communist”) show us what this specific
