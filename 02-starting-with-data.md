The two main goals for this lessons are:

- To make sure that learners are comfortable with working with data frames, and
  can use the bracket notation to select slices/columns.


::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe what a data frame is.
- Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame.
- Summarize the contents of a data frame.
- Subset values from data frames.
- Change how character strings are handled in a data frame.
- Examine and change date formats.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What is a data.frame?
- How can I read a complete csv file into R?
- How can I get basic summary information about my dataset?
- How are dates represented in R and how can I change the format?

## What are data frames?

Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Data frames are analogous to
the more familiar spreadsheet in programs such as Excel, with one key difference.
Because columns are vectors,
each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](fig/data-frame.svg){alt='A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.'}

Data frames can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read_csv()` or `read_table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). We will now demonstrate how to
import tabular data using `read_csv()`.

## Presentation of the Clicks YouTube data

We will be working with a dataset of 200 Youtube posts. Here is some background to the dataset.

An initial dataset of 314 posts were returned by the YouTube API in response to the following query: "Query: clicks south africa* hair (ad OR advertisement) -click" covering videos posted during the period 2020 - 2023
The dataset was prepared using a spreadsheet and OpenRefine to identify missing values, change variable names to "snake case", change tags and topics to lowercase, and to use semicolons to separate tags and topics.
Owing to the ambiguity of the keyword "clicks", many irrelevant results were returned. The dataset was reviewed and any posts which were not related to the controversy, or which did not relate to issues about body politics and racism were excluded.
This resulted in a dataset of 200 posts selected for computational analysis.
In case you need a refresher, here are some details about how YouTube API derives the 
[variables in this dataset](https://supermetrics.com/docs/integration-youtube-public-data-fields/).

We will be using a subset of the dataset that was prepared in OpenRefine (`data/youtube-27082024-open-refine-200-na.csv`). In this dataset, the missing data is encoded as "na", each row holds
information for a single YouTube video, and the columns
represent                                                                                   |

## Importing data

You are going to load the data in R's memory using the function `read_csv()`
from the **`readr`** package, which is part of the **`tidyverse`**; learn
more about the **`tidyverse`** collection of packages
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
**`readr`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation.
When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library(tidyverse)`), the core packages
(the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded, including **`readr`**.

Before proceeding, however, this is a good opportunity to talk about conflicts.
Certain packages we load can end up introducing function names that are already
in use by pre-loaded R packages. For instance, when we load the tidyverse 
package below, we will introduce two conflicting functions: `filter()` and `lag()`.
This happens because `filter` and `lag` are already functions used by the stats
package (already pre-loaded in R). What will happen now is that if we, for
example, call the `filter()` function, R will use the `dplyr::filter()` version
and not the `stats::filter()` one. This happens because, if conflicted, by 
default R uses the function from the most recently loaded package. Conflicted
functions may cause you some trouble in the future, so it is important that we
are aware of them so that we can properly handle them, if we want.

To do so, we just need the following functions from the conflicted package:  

- `conflicted::conflict_scout()`: Shows us any conflicted functions.  
- `conflict_prefer("function", "package_prefered")`:  Allows us to choose the
default function we want from now on.  

It is also important to know that we can, at any time, just call the function
directly from the package we want, such as `stats::filter()`.

Even with the use of an RStudio project, it can be difficult to learn how to
specify paths to file locations. Enter the **here** package! The here package
creates paths relative to the top-level directory (your RStudio project). These
relative paths work *regardless* of where the associated source file lives
inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different
subdirectories.  This is an important contrast to using `setwd()`, which
depends on the way you order your files on your computer.

One direction, not here, leads to a scary dark forest with spiders and absolute filepaths, while the other leads to a sunny, green meadow, and a city below a rainbow and a world free of absolute filepaths.

</figure>

Before we can use the `read_csv()` and `here()` functions, we need to load the
tidyverse and here packages.

Also, if you recall, the missing data is encoded as "na" in the dataset.
We'll tell it to the function, so R will automatically convert all the "na"
entries in the dataset into `NA`.


``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

videos <- read_csv(
  here("data", "SAFI_clean.csv"), 
  na = "na")
```

In the above code, we notice the `here()` function takes folder and file names
as inputs (e.g., `"data"`, `"youtube-27082024-open-refine-200-na.csv"`), each enclosed in quotations
(`""`) and separated by a comma. The `here()` will accept as many names as are
necessary to navigate to a particular file
(e.g., `here("analysis", "data", "surveys", "clean", "youtube-27082024-open-refine-200-na.csv")`).

The `here()` function can accept the folder and file names in an alternate format,
using a slash ("/") rather than commas to separate the names. The two methods are
equivalent, so that `here("data", "youtube-27082024-open-refine-200-na.csv")` and
`here("data/youtube-27082024-open-refine-200-na.csv")` produce the same result. (The slash is used on all
operating systems; backslashes are not used.)

If you were to type in the code above, it is likely that the `read.csv()`
function would appear in the automatically populated list of functions. This
function is different from the `read_csv()` function, as it is included in the
"base" packages that come pre-installed with R. Overall, `read.csv()` behaves
similar to `read_csv()`, with a few notable differences. First, `read.csv()`
coerces column names with spaces and/or special characters to different names
(e.g. `interview date` becomes `interview.date`). Second, `read.csv()`
stores data as a `data.frame`, where `read_csv()` stores data as a different kind of data frame called a `tibble`.
We prefer tibbles because they have nice printing properties among other
desirable qualities. Read more about tibbles
[here](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

The second statement in the code above creates a data frame but doesn't output
any data because, as you might recall, assignments (`<-`) don't display
anything. (Note, however, that `read_csv` may show informational
text about the data frame that is created.) If we want to check that our data
has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name:
`videos` in the console.


``` r
videoss
```

``` error
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'videoss' not found
```

``` r
## Try also
## view(videos)
## head(videos)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Note

`read_csv()` assumes that fields are delimited by commas. However, in several
countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is
used as a field delimiter. If you want to read in this type of files in R,
you can use the `read_csv2` function. It behaves exactly like `read_csv` but
uses different parameters for the decimal and the field separators. If you are
working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out
the help for `read_csv()` by typing `?read_csv` to learn more. There is also
the `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data files, and `read_delim()` allows you
to specify more details about the structure of your file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Note that `read_csv()` actually loads the data as a tibble.
A tibble is an extension of `R` data frames used by the **`tidyverse`**. When
the data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class
`tbl_df`, `tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object with


``` r
class(videos)
```

``` output
[1] "spec_tbl_df" "tbl_df"      "tbl"         "data.frame" 
```

As a `tibble`, the type of data included in each column is listed in an
abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here `key_ID` is a
column of floating point numbers (abbreviated `<dbl>` for the word 'double'),
`channel_title` is a column of characters (`<chr>`) and the `published_at` is a
column in the "date and time" format (`<dttm>`).

## Inspecting data frames

When calling a `tbl_df` object (like `videos` here), there is already a lot
of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows,
the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of
data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this
information from data frames.  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
functions. Let's try them out!

Size:

- `dim(videos)` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first
  element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
  the object)
- `nrow(videos)` - returns the number of rows
- `ncol(videos)` - returns the number of columns

Content:

- `head(videos)` - shows the first 6 rows
- `tail(videos)` - shows the last 6 rows

Names:

- `names(videos)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
  `data.frame` objects)

Summary:

- `str(videos)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
  length and content of each column
- `summary(videos)` - summary statistics for each column
- `glimpse(videos)` - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble,
  the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the
  screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, `glimpse()` is not a
  "base R" function so you need to have the `dplyr` or `tibble` packages loaded to
  be able to execute it.

Note: most of these functions are "generic." They can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames or tibbles.

## Subsetting data frames

Our `videos` data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions).
In practice, we may not need the entire data frame; for instance, we may only
be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set
of variables (the columns). If we want to
access some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" (i.e., indices) we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip

Subsetting a `tibble` with `[` always results in a `tibble`.
However, note this is not true in general for data frames, so be careful!
Different ways of specifying these coordinates can lead to results with
different classes. This is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson
[R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:


``` r
videos[, -1]          # The whole tibble, except the first column

`tibble`s can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by
calling their column names directly:


``` r
videos["channel_title"]       # Result is a tibble

videos[, "channel_title"]     # Result is a tibble

videos[["channel_title"]]     # Result is a vector

videos$channel_title          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct
names of the columns.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

1. Create a tibble (`videos_100`) containing only the data in
  row 100 of the `videos` dataset.

Now, continue using `videos` for each of the following activities: 

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble?

- Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble.
- Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
  sure it's meeting expectations.
- Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
- Create a new tibble (`videos_last`) from that last row.

3. Using the number of rows in the videos dataset that you found in
  question 2, extract the row that is in the middle of the dataset. Store
  the content of this middle row in an object named `videos_middle`.
  (hint: This dataset has an odd number of rows, so finding the middle is a
  bit trickier than dividing n\_rows by 2. Use the median( ) function and what
  you've learned about sequences in R to extract the middle row!

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
  `head(videos)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the
  videos dataset.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution


``` r
## 1.
videos_100 <- videos[100, ]
## 2.
# Saving `n_rows` to improve readability and reduce duplication
n_rows <- nrow(videos)
videos_last <- videos[n_rows, ]
## 3.
videos_middle <- videos[median(1:n_rows), ]
## 4.
videos_head <- videos[-(7:n_rows), ]
```

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is
converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and
usable during analyses. A best
practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your
date is available as a separate variable. In our dataset, we have a
column `published_at` which contains information about the
year, month, and day that the interview was conducted. Let's
convert those dates into three separate columns.


``` r
str(videos)
```

We are going to use the package **`lubridate`**, , which is included in the **`tidyverse`** installation and should be loaded by default. 
However, if we deal with older versions of tidyverse (2022 and ealier), we can manually load it by typing `library(lubridate)`.

If necessary, start by loading the required package:


``` r
library(lubridate)
```

The lubridate function `ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day,
and converts it to a `Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as
being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the function
requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted
as "YYYY-MM-DD".

Let's extract our `published_at` column and inspect the structure:


``` r
dates <- videos$published_at
```

``` warning
Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `published_at`.
```

``` r
str(dates)
```

``` output
 NULL
```

When we imported the data in R, `read_csv()` recognized that this column
contained date information. We can now use the `day()`, `month()` and  `year()`
functions to extract this information from the date, and create new columns in
our data frame to store it:


``` r
videos$day <- day(dates)
```

``` warning
Warning: tz(): Don't know how to compute timezone for object of class NULL;
returning "UTC".
```

``` error
Error in `$<-`:

``` r
videos$month <- month(dates)
```

``` warning

Notice the three new columns at the end of our data frame.

In our example above, the `published_at` column was read in correctly as a
`Date` variable but generally that is not the case. Date columns are often read
in as `character` variables and one can use the `as_date()` function to convert
them to the appropriate `Date/POSIXct`format.

Let's say we have a vector of dates in character format:


``` r
char_dates <- c("7/31/2012", "8/9/2014", "4/30/2016")
str(char_dates)
```

``` output
 chr [1:3] "7/31/2012" "8/9/2014" "4/30/2016"
```

We can convert this vector to dates as :


``` r
as_date(char_dates, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```

``` output
[1] "2012-07-31" "2014-08-09" "2016-04-30"
```

Argument `format` tells the function the order to parse the characters and
identify the month, day and year. The format above is the equivalent of
mm/dd/yyyy. A wrong format can lead to parsing errors or incorrect results.

For example, observe what happens when we use a lower case y instead of upper
case Y for the year.


``` r
as_date(char_dates, format = "%m/%d/%y")
```

``` warning
Warning: 3 failed to parse.
```

``` output
[1] NA NA NA
```

Here, the `%y` part of the format stands for a two-digit year instead of a
four-digit year, and this leads to parsing errors.

Or in the following example, observe what happens when the month and day
elements of the format are switched.


``` r
as_date(char_dates, format = "%d/%m/%y")
```

``` warning
Warning: 3 failed to parse.
```

``` output
[1] NA NA NA
```

Since there is no month numbered 30 or 31, the first and third dates cannot be
parsed.

We can also use functions `ymd()`, `mdy()` or `dmy()` to convert character
variables to date.


``` r
mdy(char_dates)
```

``` output
[1] "2012-07-31" "2014-08-09" "2016-04-30"
```
