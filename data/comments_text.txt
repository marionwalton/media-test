Thank you for sharing ❤
Doesn’t turmeric stain the skin?
No..but it stays on long..but after a time you'll see the difference in your skin
Yes this is amazing
"Jesus is coming back. Are you born again? If not, secure your eternity today. You do not have to go to hell. Jesus paid the price for all your sins. If you want to be born again Say the following prayer but you also have to believe it: Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins that you was buried and rose from the dead the third day. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior."
"Will try, thank you. Nice and simple. ❤"

"Guys, if you wanna grow hair on your face.. Use vaseline. 🤦🏽‍♀️"

Daily or week?
Can it be applied on whole body for lighter and smoother skin?
Why do you want a lighter skin? Just love yourself
Can it be applied for the whole body to achieve smooth and light skin?
"trust me you don’t need to have lighter skin, your skin is beautiful and glowing, be comfortable in your own skin ❤️"
I thought it isn't good to leave tumeric overnight
"I do this however I stopped leaving it on overnight and just let it sit 15 to 20 minutes or even 30 but no longer overnight because I have sensitive skin. Also there's an Indian Tumeric Hydrating Gel Mask that I just purchased (not expensive at all) called ""Indian Tumeric Gel Cream Mask"" by Freeman and it's pretty cool."
Yes..only five minutes...using it once a week with mud is good...

I bet more than 99% of the EFF supporters had never heard of the offending shampoo until their political leaders got wind of it. How to stoke the racial fires of anarchy in an already economically unstable country. To recover an economy in the middle of a Punch and Judy show is certainly a challenge.

We are still awaiting who the actual people were putting the add together. The rumour is that is was developed by black people, can we please get the facts, because if it is true..."
"We know it's not true. Them racists will never give black people full control like that! It's them racists who did, they may have been blacks sure. They must also be fired, coconuts"
"Well prove it. Tell us who the panel members were that developed it. Also do a timeline and process sign-off and indicate race. It is very strange that this inormation is not shared. I am sure that if it a mostly black panel did it, it would not be news highlights in this galaxy and beyond. We need facts first so give us the race grouping of the creative panel as well as all those that sign-off, do not automatically just jump to an emotional conclusion."

"Better the devil you know than the one you don't know, so they say , but i say, better the angel you know that the one you don't know , because he might be an angel of doom ! Lesego I'm black South African woman but it's sad to say to you I have lost hope and trust in my own people, our leaders! Lesego I believe the reason we are not voting for EFF is that EFF are racists themselves, full of hatred to the whites with passion. Look now how hash is EFF reacting to this Clicks advert and who are the people who are going to suffer here? BLACK PEOPLE!! I believe one of the reasons for not voting for them is because EFF will make us to go to Zimbabwe- they will turn this country in a state Zimbabwe is right now, just like Mugabe did. He took the whites out of Zimbabwe and brought the country 's economy to it's knees, when he was living a lavish lifestyle with his family the poor Zimbabweans had to cross borders for a piece of bread. We cannot deny the fact that a white man is still having full control of this country- economy. So imagine what if we vote them in what will happen to the majority of South African aka poor people . I wish that EFf can push empowering of a black young south Africans first. When a young black south Africans are economically empowered we can then vote for them knowing that we have nothing to lose should they ( EFF) take over governance in this nation. Lesego i hope you get my point for now."

"I think Clicks is deliberately instigating this, they want us to retaliate, what agenda is the elite on about now? looks like distraction to me something else is on the pipeline..."
Eff  / Malema are a racist terrorist gang ..same as Mugabe / Mangagwa Zanu pf.....  they will be happy when the ordinary people have to eat grass and bugs to survive while they  sip five star whisky. …….Banana republic deluxe.
Why eff attack corruptipn address Squarter Camps etc. Only Devil comes to Steal Rob Destroy. Vengeance is Gods . Well carry on you will meet your Moses as it is said. Soon
Julius Malema is a Real Racist.

"What Click's staff members have done is completely unacceptable and thoise staff members should be dismissed. However it does not give the EFF the right to violate the law, or the constitution, instruct the Police how to enforce the law, or prevent sick people from obtaining critical medication, intimidating the public, trespassing on private property or stop any business from operating. They are simply lawless."
"So from what I've learnt an hour ago from the CEO, Clicks is not responsible for creating the advert, but rather it belongs to Tresseme which belongs to Unilever... If they have the guts there be outside Unilever headquarters. However Clicks did say their digital team where responsible for allowing it to be uploaded, so it's a 'yikes' moment for them."
"But the team responsible for uploading the image included 2 whites, 2 blacks and 1 coloured manager. What will happen if after further investigation they find out that it was a black guy that uploaded it? Will the black guy be prosecuted for racism? Or even the coloured guy who signed off the advert, his hair is probably more like a black persons hair than a white persons hair anyway..."
I'm sick and tired of everything being about race. We can't be united because we're too sensitive about everything.
"True, but then again the post were unacceptable"

@Derrick Matthews xem EFF IT WILL NEVER C THE LIGHT
Should be 12 EFF people protest at Clicks. Seems hardly any members pitched up at any clicks. Varies from 7 to 12 EFF members. There is more reporters on scene then protesters.
Clicks and dicks }:‑)
Maybe if she had some wipers on her windshield she'd be able to hear better.....lol.....Clicks died because of Covid 19.
"Instead of the EFF concentrating on the Mismanagement,Corruption + Nepotism of the ANC . Clicks has apologised, i dont believe it was their intention to discriminate, stupid yes,but not deliberate. If i was Clicks, i would shut the stores Nationwide in SA for a whole week. Make the EFF happy. Who then will suffer the most, Black+Coloured. the most vulnerable of our society would suffer. This is how dumb the EFF is + the tragedy, people vote for the EFF"
True
The LOOTERS at it again..........
looks like they are busy iLLiminating each other with Covid.
In 2020 there is no excuse clicks should never have done that.
And Eff is bored with their lifes so I decide to protest about stuff that's not important
"I don't know if it's just me noticing the security,police guards/ the color. Like really🤬🤬🤬"
The mall should sue SABC for not complying what was said to them not to film inside the mall maybe next time they will listen?
What was Clicks thinking mara? They did this deliberately to provoke us- an African child!!!
All losses to shops that would have money by the EFF actions can be clammed from the EFF party for looses in court.
Stupid
So does this mean you in support of what clicks did?
The EFF is going into privet property the right of admin is reserved to the mall by law.
Blah blah blah viva eff
"As long as you in a public area you are allowed to use your camera as you want.if one doesnt want to be on camera stay indoors.most private property always state""this is a private property dont trespass"" so everyone in the mall is trespassing. ""In South Africa, any person can take a photograph that includes any other person, without permission. A photographer does not need your permission to take your photograph, if he or she is on public property when he or she does so."""
"@@tashinganyandoro6924 try to research before you make yourself stupid.

What I meant was that turning what could've been a ""peaceful"" protest into one that leads to burning and/or closing down a convenient store that is essential to the public and harrasing innocent people who had nothing to do with this (because this is how we deal with issues in SA) is quite stupid in my opinion. To me it clearly states that they are doing this to push their own agenda at our own expense. You take it however you want it but at the end of the day it's the people that suffer from the consequences not the politicians....calling out clicks and those behind the ad was necessary not the other actions that came after."

"Yes, and I can't get my chronic medication which I urgently need. Wonder if I could sue the EFF if I have a heart attack."
One thing is sure - the EFF is diminishing their chances of becoming a party of note in South Africa. And congratulations to the African Americans for setting such a wonderful example to others around the world with their so-called 'peaceful' protest in which they are trashing their own cities and economies.
HOW DARE YOU ASSUME THOSE THINGS ABOUT PEOPLES CULTURE EFF?!?! How dare you assume that all black people have the same hair! Shame on you EFF! Disgusting!

Wear our natural hair and be supported by men wearing black hair. Clicks have started to make us realise the way to be proud and start the business. We do not need to fight fire with fire but to show them that we are proud of who we are.
Yes gal..#blackhairday must be celebrated

"So the white women can also do something has it mentions that they have flat hair, url worried more about hair than the government dam stealing all our dam money go sort that out then worry about hair stories which is least of our problems.

Apparently no white women wants fine and flat hair 🤔 that's the defence from the white community. Apparently it makes no difference to the black community 🤔
but dont blacks hate their own afro hair? Clciks advert simply reflected reality on the ground.
"I love my hair because it’s a reflection of my soul. It’s dense, it’s kinky, it’s soft, it’s textured, it’s difficult, it’s easy and it’s fun. That’s why I love my hair. That’s why my brand Taffy Aesthetic hair has a black African women as it’s cover , I am not against any race or taking sides but simply doing the little that I can for my fellow Africans and the best for my business as well🌺"

"WHERE ARE The ENGLISH TEACHERS? No one is looking at the CONTEXT ! In the world of Shampoos all over the world the words "" FINE"" and "" FLAT "" have a different meaning. Go look at all shampoo's . The white lady has "" fine"" and ""flat"" hair this is NOT GOOD in the world of hair - it means her hair was too thin "" fine"" and too "" "" flat"" her hair did not have volume and bounce - SO this shampoo would FIX her problem and she would then have NORMAL hair - There was NO RACISM intended here - that is why no one in the team picked up the problem."
"lol then they must have said thin, not fine, the advert was wrong beat it."
Selini I have said this all along but no rasict we must be because we feel so inferior .
"Thank you English teacher for clarifying that the white woman's hair will go from fine/flat hair to normal hair...........Am I the only one who is now confused why the black woman's hair will go from dry and damaged to dull and frizzy. I detect zero racism here, thank you sooo much for clarity!"

The Mitch Rules Yessss
"How do you raise a generation of young black women, to be proud of their rich lustrous melanin, and their versatile untamed African curls and knots, to be proud of their unique heritage and at the end of the day, themselves, in a world that dehumanizes, mocks and ultimately stigmatizes our bountiful beauty in an undignified attempt to claim market share, this is unacceptable. To think of what the black community has had to endure this 2020, this tops the list. If we aren't dealing with systematic racism, we're dealing with unprecedented and often dehumanizing mockery and remarks about our beautiful untamed, gravity defiant curls and our unique rich dark chocolate skin. This has to change. I still refuse to believe that in this very day and age, a human being possessing accurate common sense finds it acceptable to dehumanize and degrade another human being. Is being black a crime? How will we raise the next generation of proud and rooted black children in a world where black is never good enough. Black hair and its beautiful knots and kinks is the one aspect of humanity that still remains original, these kinks are so powerful, not even scientce could define them, so why should we not be proud our curls? An ignorant society will never understand the amount of effort, time and ultimately respect that these beautiful kinks bring forth to black women and girls. Black is beautiful, black is power, black is gold. This pathetic unprecedented mockery of our people needs to end."
We have to continue
"@@njana8820 unfortunately girls like us who come from average income families cannot afford any of those fancy produce, which is why for example sunlight soap is my form of hair shampoo, and Hercules castor oil which is R18.99 is my hair growth oil, what purpose does tresemme serve on flawlessly natural hair such as mine. My dear you need to learn to look at life from not only your perspective. African hair has prestige, often from absolutely nothing but proper care, assuming that we cannot survive without for e.g tresemme is just pure ignorance because you might never understand why the ad was deemed offensive in the first place. This goes beyond the ad, sometimes the world tends to forget that a lot of shaming towards black girls is always about hair(I'd be more than glad to name a few incidents if you would like me to) , the backlash is just a response to the build up of anger black girls havr been suppressing for some time now."
"@@njana8820 I respect your opinion and understand where you might be coming from, but you need to understand that for example girls like me have dealt with often unprecedented remarks about our hair, not because its dry, dull or damaged but simply because it's kinky, and throughout time kinks have received unprecedented side eyes and unpleasant comments, please be aware of that."

I think to fight this where it matters and sends a strong message let’s stop buying hair cos most of the racialistic other people invest on selling hair where mainly Black females are consumers cos they are looking for beautiful straight silky long hair . They even get excited by inches involved that cost them more money . We shall appreciate the donation esp now where COVID has added to existing poverty. But what says ANC-as the government of today?
"All the time when these people offend us, they offer us money. Kanti keng? They sit in their boardroom and think if we give them pap they will keep quiet. Even with dove advert they offered us money. 😨😨😨😨😨"

"An update to our valued Clicks Customers: Clicks delists TRESemmé brand, expands range of local haircare products and works with government to develop local beauty market. All employees responsible for publishing the offensive advertisement have been suspended. Clicks has accepted the resignation of the senior executive responsible. Cape Town, 8 September 2020 – Clicks is implementing a number of proactive measures to drive diversity and inclusivity, while helping develop and expand the local beauty market, in partnership with the government. Apart from suspending all employees involved in publishing the recent offensive advertisement, Clicks has accepted the resignation of the senior executive responsible. CEO Vikesh Ramsunder says all suspended employees will go through a fair and unbiased disciplinary hearing, overseen by an independent outside chairperson. In a key update, Ramsunder says Clicks will be delisting and removing all TRESemmé products from shelf with immediate effect and will be replacing the gap with locally sourced haircare brands, of which Clicks has an extensive range already. Furthermore, Clicks will be engaging with all suppliers to enforce their ethical code of conduct. In addition, Clicks has been involved in extensive discussions with the departments of labour and trade and industry over the past few days and will be working closely with them to help develop the local beauty market in South Africa. “We recognise this event has had a significant impact on our people and our customers and we have taken a decision to close our stores for a day on Wednesday 9 September. We will use this opportunity to engage directly with all our store staff across the county, to provide counselling and support.

Customer update: Clicks has delisted TRESemmé brand and is working to develop local beauty market
You are soooo beautiful your hair😍😍😍😍😍 wamie♡
Am I the only one or is it also Owamie's beauty for you too?
💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾 The background!!
Who are they fooling with their no-sense apology
You look so beautiful today and the background keeps gives me life every time you change it 😻
N mind U racism is not only in Clicks we are also suffering the same thing at our work place but U have approach in a polite way
"AN APOLOGY THAT DOES NOT HIT YOUR POCKET, IS NOT AN APOLOGY FELT. Thank you, Owami!!! Sis, I'm taking this forward! Beautifully put!"
ban all wigs and weegs. there were black staff who approve of all this foolishness.
N what EFF did by damaging properties of Clicks I find very stupid cz they laterally destroying black people cz most of them will be unemployed due to stupid decisions.....yes Clicks was wrong
Here is my testimony:::: since I started doing my own hair n using natural remedies like raw Aloe my hair has grown a lot n it's no longer breaking like it used to the time I was relaxing my hair. Funny enough when I researched about hair relaxers I found out that they damage hair together with their styling gels n they prevent hair from growing to its normal length n I've seen that with myself. N soon I'll consult with you Owamie I wanna start my YouTube channel 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🤣😂 I also thought I was blocked. Went to check the Chanel and saw no new videos. This is old news but I just wanna hear your opinion
CLICKS MUST FALL..you can see that the whole marketing team's has been doing this for a while.
"Hey, I also thought I was blocked😂😂😂😂😂😂😂, even though I saw the insta notice"
You are Gorgeous Owamie!!!!!
We are not our ancestors 😂😂
I love your hair this way Owamie - it brings a certain unique quality to your character and blends naturally well with your presentation style which is also so natural and spontaneous
I thought that fine and flat hair is a negative thing for white people. It was not meant as a compliment coz good hair for them is rich and full. It was saying negative traits of both black and white and how their products can help..... I might be wrong tho. It was my understanding of it.
"Not to step on anyone, ive always wondered why black people use Tresemme , is it for african hair vele?"
😂😂😂 It does the work...
Owami thee business woman. Gaaaal
Black women we should adorn our beautiful natural hair more 😍 the wigs don’t even look this cute
"Clicks, Dischem and any other store that sells Tresemme products should sell their Tresemme products at a 15% discount for every black person in the next 6 months... now that is a real apology. .. we tired of this..."
What if they put a slow killer of hair in their Botanic range product that blacks wil catch on years l8a like devacurl did. We cannot trust anymore
My ninja this is not a wine it is a grape juice 🍷🤣🤣
how about we return tresemme product we have in our closet
Ninja checking in. I also checked if you uploaded a video yesterday coz I wanted to know about the clicks saga.
"This was not a mistake. ADVERTISING is VERY EXPENSIVE, they were very much aware of what they were doing. And it requires several procedures and double checking. Clicks was very much aware of this. The apology is rubbish"
I used to use tresemme products but not any more!!
Same WhatsApp group
I am unable to can just with Clicks and Trsemme.. I'm boycotting them... I'm so upset with them. The support we've shown them over the years!?
Its so sad shem
"Girl, if we as black women could recoup our coins from Clicks we’d be rich mos. I’ve been supporting Clicks since I was a teenager I am now 30 years old. It infuriates me that they don’t even respect our Rands that we’ve spent on them as Black women and girls."
Clicks are NUNJUS ne 😂😂😂😍😍😍😍
Yes🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love your look.. ❤️
Thank you ninja

Sorry themselves we not playing here
EFF's foot is on their necks
As soon as I saw that I was so pissed I have never been so mad I don't know who this people think they are. And I'm so happy that EFF exist to deal with things like this on our behalf bathong we love the way we look this is our hair we love it and we so proud of our natural hair
I am still mad shuuu
Owamie they understand very well whtt they are doing BUT Basile!!!! Unfortunately our black sisters and brothers aren't in positions to have a say. But vele let's boycott for 6 months.
Shuuuu we boycott
But what happens to clicks employees during this 6 months period?
Can we wear our natural look. That is the only solution.
We must be free ninja to do anything they just need to stop disrespecting us
Kaloku we still need hair care products to maintain out natural look
@@vuyokazi1797 That is true and we can fill in the gap and come up with something that suit our skins. For example a sun screen that I can use. I always get a rush when I apply sun screens. Just my view.
@@OwamieEntertainment I agree Ninja.
@@asiphileni8949 try the derm opal sunscreen it's even black owned.
@@vuyokazi1797 there's actually quite a number of black hair care products you just wont find them at retail outlets. I think we all know why.
I would appreciate it if u could name a few of those products- esp for 4c hair ... I am currently using Aunty Jackie which American 🙈 if I’m not mistaken ... black pearl range I found not not be good for me... so I would really appreciate direction... and also there are platforms like takealot where brethren can sell on... I’m just thinking out loud ....
​ @Vuyo Gwayi I do not have natural hair but I have dreadlocks. I use black chic as a hairfood for sculp and that all I use on my hair. I wash it with Green bar soap sunlight or a shampoo only if I go to the salon. On 4c hair please checkout on South African youtubers that are promoting black owned products. Like ASL Buthelezi and Yolz is very informative on black brands. Even Owami works with a lot of black brands where he give them shout out. I just do not pay attention as I do not have the hair. please Owamie do not block me. I am just referring a Ninja to a channel that make natural hair.
@@asiphileni8949 locs are a type of natural hair dear so you do have natural hair. I too have locs
Thabo n Nosipho Nkosi Enkosi kakhulu... will check them out ... I twisted my Afro in Feb this year
@@mathabomokoena2229 Ohh Thank you so much I will definitely try it. I am glad I got a referal
@@mathabomokoena2229 Mine is different I crotch so it is not that much. I only use black chic for scalp and green bar sunlight for washing.
@@vuyokazi1797 check out @beautyontapp on Instagram they are a E-commerce shop
"@@vuyokazi1797 theres ruutos and native child on instagram too, do check them out. I use ruutos."
Oh we don't need such pressure for ourselves that's why when a person of our calibre shave their head or wear a weave or do braids or dread locks is just oukay keep it up no standards... there are people who wear wigs because of cancer or other things affecting hair... versatility accommodates them
​ @God's child I understand you Ninja and well said.
@@godschild2716 I understand you. I meant that is the only way we can boycott the companies that do not see their customers.
Natural hair suits you Owamie and I Also have natural hair and I know it beautifully 😊 Morning ninjas ❤☕
Thank you ninja goodmorning
Guys 😊 Owamie has been replying to comments lately and I feel honored 🥳😊😊
@@thandolwethu_SibuM cleaning up so i can freely talk to my people 😍
And we need more cartoons with black characters. For the first time my 3years old daughter mentioned she wants hair like Elsa from frozen. I shall keep her hair natural and curly like mine. Yoo we cant have that.Were conditioned from a young age to think white hair is better than black hair.
That is sooo true

Id never 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 they tried it
"I said you very addictive,I have not trained.i have done nothing. I have a mountain to climb 😀. Owami your facial expressions."

"Hey Ninja, I use Aunt Jackie products by Dwan Vine white- black owned. They work very well for my hair. You can get them at Takealot and many other places. I used to get them from clicks. Clicks is such a big company and this is how they chose to behave, disappointing to say the least."
Noted ❤
Hey Nthabiseng Auntie Jackie revealed beginning of this year when there was a twitter hashtag about black owned products that they are not black owned. You can check on their Instagram page.
"Thatano Maine 😔 I just saw that.I’m conflicted. It is owned by House of Cheatham, which also owns Africa’s Best. Wow! 😭their products are so good though 😩😩😩"
@@nthabisengp6229 Lol.. It's fine to use them.. It works for ur hair and they have not disrespected you..

Me too shem
You look fire today 🔥🔥🔥natural hair looks good on you❤️
Thank you ninja ❤
"Clicks and Tresseme are dead wrong but let's fix ourselves as the black community. I don't know how many times I've heard fellow black people equating us wearing our natural hair to poverty, being dirty and less beautiful. Personally I wear my hair in an afro because relaxed it doesn't look healthy and I'm one of those with very light hair so when it's relaxed I look like a wet cat. Let's truly love ourselves and be accepting of ourselves, WE ARE BEAUTIFUL AND JUST AS GOOD"
"Our natural hair is so beautiful, look at mine, fluffy and full."
We need to fall in love with who we are fully
@@OwamieEntertainment yes darling❤
Not a wet cat 💀💀💀💀😩😩😩😩
Wet cat part so accurate 🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😝😝😝
Ad like that mskes people not to appreciate their hair
thanks Owamie. Consequences need to follow. No excuses no charity work necessary.
Vele my ninja and i did not forget about you ne😘
@@OwamieEntertainment 💖🤗
"In my opinion, there is no way they can explain themselves out of this. I think that they could have used caucasian hair in one comparison- because I have seen plenty of their hair looking dry and damaged! In another comparison, because they are clearly aiming to be ‘inclusive’ and want the ‘black rand,’ use African hair. Don’t compare oranges to apples!! The trouble is, they lack context and keep their boardrooms as white as possible, yet still want to cater for those outside of the white demographic. It is utter DISRESPECT and CONDESCENSION!!! We can talk all day about this but the ultimate answer is to hit them where it hurts- their POCKETS. Give your hard-earned money to those who recognise, consider and respect you."
Or Use white people hair before and after they use their products

This is why it's important that black mothers stop buying white dolls for their young daughters and start considering having to buy a black doll instead.
And allowing their kids to speak English at home as if their native language is not good enough.

Thank you 😊
Thank you to show us video l like your hair
"Thank you Norma, which other videos did you enjoy? 😊"
"OK so I tried the complete Afri-tru range. Im type 3c and the shampoo is awful. Seems Like it contains sulphates. It did not soften my hair it actually made my hair extra dry and hence the conditioner did not provide easy detangling. The curl creme is excellent The gel was the bomb, until a few weeks in and I started noticing the residue and flakiness. Leave in conditioner, I love"
"Lol I’m sorry that the products didn’t work for your hair. I hated that conditioner till someone said I should use it as a deep conditioner and apply on dripping hair. The water will help break it down a bit. I didn’t like the gel at all but then again, I hate all gels 😬."
I like your hair. I'm thinking of switching from the Pearl hair juice to another leave in so I'm looking around
"Thank you so much 😊, the truth is, you and I are in the same boat. I haven’t truly found a leave in conditioner that just leaves my heart smiling as of yet. However I have used the Aunt Jackie’s leave in and my hair liked it and it smells amazing 😵😵"
😍❤️🥺
You could do with a little less talking and a lot more illustrations.we had to wait 7 minutes before you could actually review the products and we didn't really see your full wash day
"Hi Boikarabelo. I was very nervous on that day, I realized on camera that I bought two conditioners and my mind just went all over the place. It was my first review lol and I had no clue what I was doing hey. But I have changed my ways and I now get straight to the point, I Am truly sorry that you had to wait 7min and didn’t get to see my full wash day, however here is an improved Wash day routine, again, I’m sorry https://youtu.be/0jzqQ-d7WJE"
Hey what products do you recommend for beginners who want to go natural (that's me tbw 😂☺)
"Hi Buhle. Whatever brand, you need a shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, leave in, some oils and some sort of cream moisturizer for your hair, to seal. There are a lot brands to pick and choose from, I’m still familiarizing myself with South African black owned brands 😬... Do you want me to be brand specific?"
Okayy thank you ❤
Ohh ii just saw the other piece of your reply Yes please cause ii was thinking of buying the new Tresemme Expert shampoo and conditioner
"Uhm I haven’t used it so I can’t comment on it, I say, research and make a decision. If you buy it, analyze your hair, listen to it, touch it... record your results, mentally. It’s your hair journey, these products could work or maybe they won’t. I’m not a product junkie so I haven’t tried most products myself lol so uhm yeah. I found what worked and stuck to it."

Tried this and 2 days later had the worst pimple rash all over my face.. guess it’s for everyone
Could be that it revived ur acne to then clear them

What is that white thing? Where did you buy it
Zinc and castor oil lotion you can get it at the pharmacy and clicks as well as dischem
Hey sis i know this is an old video but i need help. After seeing uour video i went on to buy the cream but now my face on some part near my mouth its breaking out if i may say it is peeling and slightly itchy is that i good sign
I didn’t experience any reaction from using the product I had breakouts but my face didn’t get irritated but after sometime it cleared. I’d say continue for a couple of days and see if it won’t clear but if things are getting worse then it could be an allergic reaction.
Hey Sisi I brought vitamin c and zic but I dnt knw how to take I drink it as it is or wat?
Hey 😄Did you buy the cream ? If so please apply it on your face at night before bed. And if it’s the tablets/pills take them as per instructions on the pack which is one pill daily.

Yes there's a huge difference in ur skin texture. Keep continuing with it till it all goes away
am using it i definitely see the results ...but you have to give it a time I think I have more than a 3 weeks now but results are amazing. ..I was having pimples and dark spots in my chicks..now it become light and go away i believe if I buy the second cream I will be good
It definitely does work especially if you are consistent which is my problem. I am using it again end excited to clear my dark spots 😊
I will try it

"Started using it 5 days ago and I can see breakouts, I think its a sing that its working but I'll also come with results after a week or so"

@@AzanaJezile you were using zinc ointment only or mixed it with castor oil B.p?
And ?
🙁I jus strted using a couple of days ago n I notice my inner part of face is turning red but by that part where I am turning red I see that my black spots are vanishing but is that a good or a bad sign?
I haven’t personally experienced that just give your skin a break for maybe a week or so just for the redness to go away.
"My face is burning, so any advice please?"
Burning from using the zinc and Castor oil ? If yes I suggest you stop using it it’s not agreeing with your skin it shouldn’t be burning
Is it good for pimples as well
I am not sure Hy I only had dark spots but it’s definitely worth the try

hi can i use it as body lotion or it is for face only?
You can definitely use it as a body lotion as well 😊
@@AzanaJezile thank you my dear
Your face is glowing! Lots of Indian women of older generation had beautiful glowy skin because of Castor oil use over the years. Nowadays it is so underated and underreviewed. If you continuing over weeks and months your skin will be near flawless. I have ditched all my expensive high end products for old time castor oil for my skin. My cleanser is Dove sensitive skin bar soap and castor oil as a moisturizer at night. During the day I use thin layer of castor oil and tea tree oil and apply 50+ Sunscreen. My skin is so much better now eversince I switched from using chemical loaded products from the time of Pandemic lockdowns. Another advantage is saving so much money from buying expensive chemical laden products. I get so much compliments for my skin now. Another factor to note is your diet has a big factor as well. Lots of water and vegatables in your diet will be an added bonus for your glowing skin. Regards from Fiji x😗
Thank you 😊 less is definitely more when it comes to skincare 🥰
How long did it started working i have pimples and na blackspot

"Yesterday I walked my dog. It barked at a customer at MC Donalds, am I a terrorist? Is my dog a terrorist? Are you a terrorist?"
And CLICKS wont have the balls to prosecute jULIUS and EFF for the damage they caused. The Corporates in SA is so shit scared of the ANC and the EFF that they are too scared to take them to task. If CLICKS do not take the EFF to court...... then I wont be supporting them with my monthly medicine spend. There is lots of cheaper & independent pharmacies around.
Your racism will NOT be tolerated. South African are fed up with your racism.
"EFF - Economic Financial Fukups. OK so we have products called ""Black Like Me"" and thats OK so why dont we have products called ""White Like Me"". And the wording of that ""offensive advert"" well did you notice they also were critical of white hair saying its flat and thin - wake up SJWs and other lefties.Because of all this some black staff might lose jobs as Clicks might close stores but that is OK to EFF and BLM (Burn Loot Murder) as long as they kick back against white it does not matter that black will suffer. Even Malcolm X in mid 1960s said the most dangerous person to a black man is the white liberal, not the conservative"
Building's doesn't belong to clicks they are renting it so the EFF is damaged other people's property

Please Renaldo bro be careful and safe at all times.you know how political parties are
you are unsucessful and which is why you turn to violence which needs no knowledge
"The funny thing about these videos is that it is only protecting Clicks and never the Poeple who were insulted in that advert, I have never heard you my man protecting the Poeple that were disrespected in that ad all I hear is how wrong the EFF and who does what but never about what really started this whole thing. I am dissapointed again, if you made a whole video talking about just Clicks racism I would maybe understand this but there is not even one video about what actually started this whole thing and that is where we getting this wrong, this is only one sided biased as most of you posts. I want to be honest in some you are really telling the truth and I support your statements but most are biased. I knw u dnt need my support but if you need us to go forward as a country and for everyone to get your message please do not be biased but if your message is not for the whole of South Africa but for certain group of Poeple continue my man."

"This is not terrorism. So then it is justifiable for white women to dye their hair and do plastic surgery, but black women cannot accessorize their hair , because it is seen as unnatural. The exactly same people who continously told black women that their natural hair does not fit their ""beauty standards"" and black women must have straight hair in order to fit their ""standard"". This is plain racism no sugar coating and no identity crisis. The hipocracy of it all.White people need to get over themselves about how racism feels for them, because they never felt the degrading and discrimination of what racism did to black people in south Africa"

We are only watching them ruin the country."
"Dear Clicks I’m seriously disappointed in you, as a company I will never enter a Clicks again. Why? Because you proofed a couple of things that makes it unsafe to enter your stores. One, you were forewarned about the plans of the EFF. You did NOTHING to protect your stores. You should have ensured that the SAPS( if you could reach them by phone, good luck by the way), is on standby. Two, you should have obtained an urgent interdict against the EFF. Three, you should have ensured that you have enough guards protecting your stores. Four, I will never work for you, because your Health and Safety procedures lack, and while you are on the accepting of resignations, accept the employee who is in charge of your health and safety’s resignation as well. He did not do his job! Five, You let yourselves be bullied, by a known bully, and did not even tried to protect or fightback. It is not as if you are a small, poor, helpless, one-man show. BTW, I would want to know who you use for security. If they allowed the destruction of property and intimidation of staff and shoppers, I would never want to have a contract with them. They are as guilty as you are, for not be pro-active."

Our judicial system sucks
SAPS are not doing their job
"Currently the main story in the media is Click’s and the advert Tresemme made for Hair. My question is why are we not perhaps discussing: The fact that Domestic Violence is on the rise- Just earlier today a woman was shot in a police station by her husband. The fact that we are in a Global Pandemic- Has everybody just forgotten about the lives that have been lost during this period of time. The fact that Child Trafficking has increased exponentially in the last short while. #SaveOur Children. The fact that a Down syndrome child was shot dead by our police- There has been no justice. The fact that we have a possible serial killer in Kwazulu Natal murdering women. The fact that we are loadsheading again and again and again… The fact that Eastern Cape has no water because the government has stolen money for the pipework, chemical etc Then blame it on a drought when the dams are full of water. The fact that farmers are dying- what are we going to eat guys? The fact that most of us are either scared of the Police or ready to pay a bribe when they come knocking. What is important- We hold nobody accountable anymore. Politicians just run around carrying on and then we suffer. Is anybody actually going to tackle corruption or are we just swopping one type of corruption for another? Lottering and destroying Clicks- what happens to our economy if they decide to close doors and take away their business? Soon it will be election time again the options are pointless. EFF destroying everything in the name of justice ANC stealing everything in the name of authority DA running circles around themselves never actually able to do anything This country is honestly in trouble when there is no party worth voting for who actually cares about the citzens, we all will fall down. If only our Politicians and their parties could fight for their citizens basic human needs like they fight for hair….. Electricity, Shelter, Schooling etc If only our Politicians and their parties could fight for the countries children like they fight for hair….. Stop Child Trafficking, Rape, Child Abuse etc If only our Politicians and their parties could fight corruption within there own ranks like they fight for hair….. End the cycle of senseless spending and give to those who actually need, pay your tenders, improve our dilapidating infrastructure, give us housing etc If only our Politicians and their parties could fight for us. Instead of fighting amongst each other and causing racial controversy between citizens. Why don’t they start at the beginning, fighting the corruption within their own parties?"
Hope this will resolve soon. What would happened to those who suppose to collect medication. I wonder if EFF did consider the damage are they doing. To vandalize it won't solve anything. 😒
"Haha so twitter suspended my account for telling malema to burn in hell and take his trash followers with him yet his account is still active, hmmm?"
Eish ! This is bad.
Ek dink ons moet so begin maak na elke plaas moord
What is racist in promoting a certain kind of shampoo with a specific problem with your hair. No one said all people s hair is dry damaged dull or thin( fine)
Hope the racist EFF looses in court and is fined to pay for the damage they caused.
This white busted think its apartheid era nooo buddy
"The irony of all this is the advert wasn't even racist to begin with... People are perceiving it to be racist. Why? I'll explain why... 1. People see the pictures featuring black women that are inscribed as dry and dull. These are legitimate issues that women face with their hair so Clicks is highlighting that problem and saying ""we have a product that will fix that"". 2. They see the white woman with hair described as fine and flat. Thinking this is a good thing when it is not... women do not like fine and flat hair. ""fine"" is actually thin hair. Notice how all adverts of hair products for women feature them with a lot of volume in their hair? That's what women like. Clicks is again saying you have flat and fine hair? ""We have a product that can fix that"". 3. They see the picture with the white woman with the description ""normal hair"" the issue here is that the woman is white and there is no black woman as an equivalent there. So people put two and two together and think this advert is saying the hair of white women is normal while the hair of black women is abnormal. That is not at all what the advert was saying but people have jumped to conclusions... knee jerk reactions from outrage culture has resulted in toxicity, divisiveness and ultimately violence... The solution here was Clicks had two options it could have taken to avoid this whole ""catastrophy"". 1. Use a black model for the ""normal hair"" picture. 2. Have a black model alongside the white model in the ""normal hair"" picture. If Clicks had done either of those two things none of this would have happened... But unfortunately South Africans are too fragile to think critically and analyze things before jumping to conclusions and crying racism where there actually isn't racism... But hey what I do know I'm just some white guy that doesn't trash pharmacies because of an advert..."
"So someone school me on the law here, let's start with an analogy. I am the get away driver for a crew of bank robbers and in the course of the robbery, let's say a security guard shoots and kills an innocent customer, or lets stretch it a bit further, another crew walks in and joins the robbery and one of them kills an innocent customer. Now as far as I know even though I was sitting outside in the get away vehicle I can and will be charged with murder as if i had pulled the trigger myself. The mere fact that my participation enabled all of this to happen makes me guilty right, or is South Africa different? The EFF claim they are not responsible for the damage and that it was done by ""agent provocateurs"" or even by the victim themselves and therefore they cannot be held responsible. The way I see it, had they not organised, participated and instructed their members to ""ATTACK!"" then there would have been no opportunity for ""agent provocateurs"" or the victim themselves to cause damage. Surely as in my analogy the EFF is responsible and can be held to account for everything that took place or am i just totally ignorant on how the law works? Yes I know in South Africa there is no such thing as law and it only applies to select individuals."
"Is is not funny that the most focused aspect of anc, eff, is based on looks.. Skin color, hair quality... What next... Eye color is racist too..."
Well said. You have the balls. They are pathetic....
"the judge that made that order should be fucking dismissed for his bias, Clearly an EFF agent. How could such an idiot be allowed at the head of the justice system?"
Don't know what you expect to come from the courts other than nothing? What happened to his highness discharging a firearm in public?
What about ill people who need med. Their prescriptions are at clicks. This is ludicrous!
"The EFFers can, and will always be allowed to, do exactly as they want because they make the ANC look moderate. EFFers all of them."
"The EFF has been paid more than R 100 mln by taxpayers since they came into parliament. For that it's members have done nothing except spread hate, racism, division and have caused destruction of private or taxpayer property. He and his colleagues are actually racist, they hate being black and also anything black hence the slavish following of expensive western brands, houses, cars etc, so they will lead ignorant black people into total destruction. EFF members have houses in Sandton and Camp's Bay, their kids go to the best schools etc. Malema often has to wear 3 Roles at a time. I often ask black and coloured people if they really believe that if land redistribution takes place, do they really think they will be the ones NOT being given barren land in the middle of the desert by the EFF? Who do they think will get the best and most valuable land?"
useless fools
And these idiots are trying to run for a leadership role in our county. 😂
"So you you-tubers would support racist attacks on black people and when there's any form of retaliation you would label it as thievery, vandalism and terrorism. If you would suggest that EFF should pay for the damages inflicted on the Clicks store, would any of you including the Clicks Store pay for the trauma these racist that attacks inflict upon the black majority in this country?"
"Trauma? Over an ad? Are you serious? You're acting as if Clicks said ""Black people should die""."
"BLM, EFF, Bolsheviks...all the same thing"

"Our country is run by thugs....when our leaders encourage this behavior, which aids the loss of jobs, income and tells us that depending on the party you belong to you have the right to bully, take the law in your hands and destroy things that do not belong to you. Where is our government. Why is nothing been said, why does our government choose to be silent. I am so disgusted by this behaviour, how does this behaviour rectify racial behavior ....😡"
"Imagine if we black people didn't do anything about the advert would this Renaldo make a video ? Nooo he wouldn't because to him its normal to offend and do bad things to black people but when back people stand up against those things its racism. All of your videos are stirring division amongs what you call rainbow nation which never existed. I'm asking this question again what is the purpose of your content? If it is to expose racism done by black people then you are just escalating something that we're already exposed to , that is soo stupid and its not helping. Come up with something that's positive and discussing solutions instead of dividing us."
Last chance for eff n his troops to steal
Race card again 😂
Does anyone have any doubt that the eff will be a violent authoritarian government?
"ONE QUESTION, Where are the police?"
Is racist nothing compared to vbs? You are no right racist sentenced Mandela to 27 years in jail

"Well done Eff we still coming to those racist private company we know them , we are machine of racism ."
"True, the EFF is a machine of racism. Quite so"
The people at clicks knew this was coming why tf didn’t they do anything about it why didn’t they prepare for it like fuck sake
Judge was biased only had hair on the brain and forgot about peoples rights. He does get that people buy their prescription medicine from Clicks right? And that this is deliberately withholding people from needed medicine
"I am not a EFF supporter however I agree with them, blackpeople are taken as morning joke in south africa, clicks makes racial ad and now they act like victims, this has nothing to do with VBS. BUT you wouldn't understand anyway."
"Dom is maar Dom....ledigheid is die duiwel so oorkussing.......ons wittes will K rulhare he, swartes wil lang reguit hare he......so what, ons ""perm"" hulle ""straighten"" .......ek kan net my kop skud want in die bos bly in die bos ""straight"" and all........."

so when do they ALL get arrested?? I see a crime being committed???
Its been over 24 hours and the President hasn't even responded. Regardless of the threats that were given ahead.
Julius and the eff are cowards they have no morales nor respect for anything they really are the trailer trash in the government.
how do you take the court to court? Hellopeter?
I wish this stupid party could be so passionate about corruption and GBV
Funny how you didn't make a video about what clicks said but you are quick to jump into terrorism
Money steeling getting less
One thing is for sure the ANC want to do what the eff do but are quite happy to use them and call them a fringe radical element of south africa. They are all the same
"At the end of the day my heart tells me there's a systematic push for some sort of global socialist communism. They're trying to dilute culture so we'll accept a new world order, they want the old world orders to crash and out of the pain and schesims we'll accept the world bank, world health org, IMF , United nations and so on. The EFF are just controlled opposition, antagonists for the ANC. Why do you think our country is so in bed with China and Cuba their commie brothers. This is an AGENDA! Anyone want to search online for the stamps and pictures of Mandela in his knight of columbus regalia being initiated and put 2 & 2 together, 1994 was a psyop."
Noh. Clicks has to suffer a bit Renaldo. I love you though
"Are you dreaming, it's 2020, we have all suffered enough. Take your self-destructive mindset to the Congo where it belongs if you can't behave in civilization."

Is this peaceful?
So where was the police??? With the video evidence are they going to be taken to court??? EFF is a terrorist organization hiding behind a so called political party.
This is not the way to go about it though🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ . . . . I'm so disappointed in the EFF and my fellow black people
"Well what did you expect from the court, since Malema is involved in selecting judges"
I will be spending my WMC on taking Clicks and the EFF to court for endangering customers and employees lives. Clicks knew this was going to happen and there was no security
I’m asking a question here. In the clicks ad the white actors are below the black actors. Why is that not offensive? This entire thing is BS. I do find it strange that people of all colors came together to protest corruption and farm murders aimed at government. How convenient this comes along to divide.🤔🤔🤔
Viva EFF!!! THE WHITE MAN HAS BROUGHT US DOWN LONG ENOUGH! FIGHT! FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE CAPITALIST PIGS. CLICKS WILL PAY FOR WHAT THEY SAID.
"Terrorism right? Is it not psychological terrorism that a company will come to a black continent to advertise a product and goes ahead to say that black hairs are dull and that only a white person's hair normal? What an effrontery. Are black peoples' hair supposed to be like white peoples' hair? What kind of insensitivity and disrespect is that? A white person's hair is normal in Europe or America, not Africa. You talk about EFF top hierarchy being aware of the damage visited on click stores but did not acknowledge the responsibility of the top management of click in respect of that advert. Do you believe the top management of clicks including the CEO did not authorize that advert? If you believe an organization of that size will not know or care about the advert that bears their company's name, I do not know what to say to you. An organization that is so insensitive as to denigrate an entire race should not be complaining when the people decide to pay them in their own coin. This is the only language these types of organizations understand. With this, they will not dare do it again. Thank God for EFF. I am not a South African but I fully understand where EFF is coming from."
"Am a black person who like seeing black People, white People, Indians, coloreds all living together in peace, harmony without segregation coz we a all equal before God even ancestors otherwise if we don't stop racism, segregation,one day we shall all perish like fools,I repeat those who promote racism,segregation a fools against humanity 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"Sadly, the EFF doesn't see it like that. They claim to want to stop racism, but they always blame everything on race."
"South Africa is a laughing stock, if I was an investor I would be taking my money out chop chop, being held ransom by thugs!!!"
Foken fools
"Oh yes this is definitely deplorable and utterly repugnant but DA( your party) is just another opportunistic political party that clearly panders for white people's interest. I mean since the news about Clicks racist advert broke out, all they have to say is ""We have laid charges against EFF for property damage""?😕"
"What else are they supposed to say? ""We laid charges for damage, and also we're really mad and upset about a fucking advertisement for shampoo?"" Come on, gain perspective. I agree with you that the DA is not fit to be voted for in its current state, but this is not the reason."
So you do agree that the ad was racist? If you think so then how would you say that should have been handled?
"The EFF have made absolute idiots of themselves once again. Please stop wasting your time, everyone else's time and trashing hard earned money. No one cares about your Micky Mouse Club. The ANC has sidestepped their criminal activities by issuing more ridiculous statements that are still not addressing the serious state of the Nation. #WOW REALLY!"
How is this allowed? Where are the cops? Where is law and order?
"If you are coloured, indain, white any colour besides black, skip this continent asap and skip the usa and england aswell. Get yourself and ur kids out as soon as you can. To be honest im not sure what is the best place to find peace and get away from blm, communism and all the s... going down. This is only the start its only going to get worse."
Malema are following thru with mandela's terrorism.
"This is just the start. Ppl are worried about the anc, they are minor. Less than 10 years from now malema wil be president then we got problems!"
White people a angry yoo😂😂 juju is still going to deal with you😂😂
But what are you saying about the offensive advertisement?
"Irrelevant. If you don't like it, boycott the offending company, like a human being would."
For how long are we gonna be spectators in the destruction of our country?
Message to Malema: Your peppercorns are not my fault. It is time to eradicate the cancer. It cannot hide. It lives in luxury.

"Renaldo, 'fine' means 'thin' not 'good'. The EFF never even had a case because thin hair is also BAD for white women, it means you look like you are going bald."

"Soz Renaldo - not Terrorism. Calling it that gives him some 'right' - maybe he has something to protest? But oh, no, wait - he was in the government right? He created a splinter-party, right? So - Authoritarianism. His challenge to Click reminded me of soooooo many speeches given by mmmmh, Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, Trump...."
"What about Fw de klerk, he killed many innocent souls and he never went to jail"
"Fuck it, clicks and eff had a deal.. Insurance payout!"
"No it's not terrorism, unfortunately it does not fall in the definition of terrorism. It is a criminal action. They should go to jail. Including Julius Malema that instigated this. Because it is criminal the state should be acting not clicks.Make no mistake the EFF have been doing this for years. They have just gotten away with it."

"Wonder what would happen, when the advert was about 1 white curly hair & 1 black straight hair?? NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN!!! Fact is:- Most of the time, Curly hair are normaly drier than straight hair, because of all the hot brushes & electric utensils & that will make it more dry & breakable!! Actualy it looks like it's not about dry or normal hair! To me it looks like black people dont like their curley hair!! No offence, scientificaly speaking!!"
"im looking for options to leave this sinking ship, best you do the same."
"The whole thing has been blown out of proportion. Complete misunderstanding. Fine and flat hair with blonde hair image is not hey girl you are looking so ""fine"". It's a reference to thin hair and flat means it has no body or bounce. Black and white where both ""insulted"" on the advert if you can even call it an insult. There was no racial slur. Mistake they made was having white and black on the advert. Should have been one or the other. Also the annotated images dont have the space to say : if you suffer from dry or curly hair/thin and flat hair use this product. What's next deodorant adverts, moisturiser adverts, makeup ads etc are all racist now??"
"Oh......I forgot to mention......we are ""proudly South African"".......are we not??????"

Steven cant you see friends help friends thats why i dont trust the law
Who was the person that approved the advert. Did YOU look into that? So its ok for the racist adverts to be flighted? Your take on this makes me think you are for what is happening in america against the blacks. #justsaying.
There are no law in this country anc must quit eff 2 we are sick of you
I needed to get my chronic meds from Clicks today..I swear if I am I'll tonight I will lay charges against Julius Malema

Right out of the democratic play book.
STF!
Solving issues regarding racism in a diplomatic way in South Africa hasn't gotten us anywhere. If this is what it takes to force people to respect black people then so be it.
NO to racial marketing. FULL STOP
"There was no racial marketing, that's the joke"
"Violence is definitely not the answer, EFF did not have to protest, if only blacks knew the power they have with their wallets, if all blacks collectively choose to not purchase from clicks that would send out a strong message than wasting time protesting, same as ANC they have done nothing but loot the country dry , caused further inequality, further creating the wealth gap and concentrating wealth in the hands of few through BEE tender nonsense. Not educating the masses was an advantage for Apartheid to thrive and that legacy is still being enjoyed by ANC thugs. How do we move this beautiful nation forward? I cannot vote for ANC, EFF or DA, why can't we have a neutral party with interest of building a stronger, safer, equal SA for all races"
"Yes. Terrorism. Using violence, fear, and intimidation in order to manipulate a population according to your will. If you have an alternative belief that offends me, I will not go to your business or house and burn it down or incite violence against you or your family. The same if you say racist things. The most racist organisation in South Africa currently, is ironically the EFF. Clicks screwed up. And what they did was clearly stupid. But I don't see any of the same people ""fighting against racism"" by burning down Malema's house every time hé says something racially offensive. This is supposed to be a modern constitutional democratic country. Where we are supposed to use civilized means to reach our goals. And where we are supposed to reason and debate our views, and where we should respect freedom of speech and opinion. And also where we do not incite violence against one another. Unfortunately, the last decade or so, has shown us, that politics in South Africa have become essentially gangsterism. And has hijacked discourse and the narrative in this country. No one is willing to hear reason. Many just seem to be driven by hatred, bitterness, envy and greed. This country, if allowed to, will become another lawless wasteland of a country. Another example to the world of what not to do."
"TF did clicks expect by promoting racism, that shit is not vendalism or terrorism that is karma. They should've known better and done better, bro this generation is not having it. Our time is inevitable!!!"
"Disagree with the Clicks CEO . Live ammo should have been used in abundance and ended violent , disruptive EFF terrorists . That is the only measure the EFF will understand , when they see their terrorist komrads lying dead beside them after having committed acts of terror and public violence , and having to be ended by the police and other law enforcement , because the courts seem no longer to want to end violence ."
"Nah, martyrs are what they want. Remember this is how the ANC organized the photo op at Sharpeville. They kept pushing, kept attacking police stations, kept killing police, until they got what they deserved, and then they took photos and cried about it."
Looting is wrong! But honestly clicks really pushed it! How can you be racist in black mans land? These are people who lived through apartheid and some who are just fed up with racism. Remember that other white guy who took a video at the Greek islands saying look how clean it looks there aren’t K****? This is what’s makes them angry! White South Africans need to learn not to be racist. It’s that simple. Stop being racist. Stop giving patriots a reason to fight
"I agree, but it's hard to grow up in South Africa and not be racist (at least to some extent). With the farm murders and the EFF singing ""kill the white man"". I agree, people shouldn't be racist, but it goes both ways."
"Nothing will happen to them, like always"
"Cyril Ramaphosa is a scared and weak President, he will never stand up against the EFF, when will the ANC learn that sitting in silence and watching through a “window” actually means that these barbaric behaviors of the EFF is acceptable to them. Destroying a business with acts of terrorism, which by international law reads under the terrorist act: “is intended to advance a political, religious or ideological cause” and (c) causes one in a list of specified harms, including death, serious injury, or serious property damage, which is exactly what the EFF is doing, but the Government won’t do anything about it."

Are we really going to bring down the country and have many innocent people loose their jobs ouver bad hair?? .... There are white people been murdered almost every day on their farms and not once has the eff even showed at least simpatie... Makes me wonder what kind of government they will be when they win the vote... By the way I am black.
"Early this year during the SONA, the EFF had 3 requests, that De Klerk leave the house, Gordhan be fired as minister and Ramaphosa not be allowed to speak. Needless to say, Gordhan is still a minister, De Klerk sat till the end and Ramaphosa finished his speech. Point I'm making is just go back in history, the EFF have not achieved anything since formation other than getting zuma to pay back the money which was done using democratic processess by going to court. Every other time they either failed to achieve their goal or they made it worse. Anyone who thinks they are achieving anything is a fool. Most of what is happening today, has been happening since they were established."
"Here's the theory , Clicks work together with the powers to heighten the racial tensions in SA . Don't tell me the agency didn't know this advertisement won't incite tension between black and white ."
But what's so Difficult for Click's to Release the names of the people who were behind the Advert.. Simple.. release the names avoid Conflict!! Simple Simple!!!
Racism is a criminal offence in SA ..so they are going to have to face the law
"Fuck all will happen... I love your show, very much. But, to assume the average south african isn't as dense as a bowl of hardened concrete.. Well, if I look at around at the shit that I see, what's being allowed. Nah my dude.. I mean, do you truly believe that we will see change?"

"South African head my words , you will stave more than what is happening in Zimbabwe today . If Clicks pack and go . Many more outside investors will plan to leave South Africa .and a rand against dollar will be 40-50 . Not long . The economy is dead for good ."

It’s funny 😄 the way they crying 😭 over Clicks undermining their hair while they wearing Chinese or Indian 🇮🇳 hair to cover their own natural hair because they are ashamed of it...😂😂😂
They hate their hair that's the real issue. Their wigs itch. Not my problem. As long as i needn't touch one.
"""They"" meaning all black people wear weaves and wigs? Can't begin to express how poorly informed that statement is and even more so, it is reflective of the unprecedented height of your stupidity which other future morons are yet to match. It is quite evident that thinking properly isn't your strongest suit and to betray your IQ this way by exposing it to be a single digit for the whole world to see is as deplorable as EFF's thuggish behaviour."

"Those poor employees are now out of work till further notice. Meaning out of pay as well! These are such hard times, no one can afford this! The EFF doesn’t realize the employees are suffering more than Clicks itself, same as with H&M!"

"@@mlungisidlamini9864 that is the implied insinuation otherwise why not embrace your skin. You are aware that shampoos are made for specific hair types right, curly, normal, dry, fizzy, oily, daily use etc. i.e. it is not personal. Ones hair is what it is. My own hair is curly but in winter it get dry and fizzy. I'm not offended. It is what it is."
Who could have predicted this? Oh right... The comments on the video yesterday.

"Cancer in this country is racism that those who are at the receiving end are sick and tired of!!! Your content is bias...as expected, 'white arrogance'!!! The only thing you have sympathized with in this stupid video of yours is ""Clicks"" and its obvious you care damn less about those affected by the advert. If you don's want anti-racism action, its simple...whether as a person or organisation, just be mindful with your words and actions!!! Because actions may have bitter consequences."

"@@tinastroswitch7007 You are blindfolded by complete stupidity if you think ""apartheid wounds"" can't be rubbed with salt and pepper just like what this racist advert did. You have no point at all so I don't know why you wish for this debate ""to be continued"" like what happens when your pudgeball self stands on a weight scale. Pointing out racism when it reveals its ugly head has nothing to do with identity-crisis and how you kangroo-jumped to that conclusion is totally beyond me and remains an absolute mystery. Many folks who commented under your post have allowed you to get off scotts-free for ostentatiously displaying this seemingly endless vicious cycle of your moronic behaviour but I am not going to let you think that what you have been sending for us to read is any better than a blank text message. When Taylor Swift put out a song called ""blank space"", I should have known that she was referring to what is between your ears but nonetheless I have eventually caught her drift. You need to invest more time in educating yourself about what identity-crisis is than coming here onto YouTube to misplace that word into a context where it doesn't fit. Apartheid is inextricably intertwined with acts of demeaning or demoralising black/coloured people and what this ad has portrayed is awfully reminiscent of that. And now according to you, I am supposed to move forward and pretend like elements of apartheid are water under the bridge and a thing of the past because this way I somehow manifest an attempt to confront the "" reality"" that clearly seems to fly past from under your nose since you have decided to bury your head into the sand and pay zero attention to what is happening around you. Not only are you a disappointment to black and coloured people but humanity as a whole and quite frankly I have a funny feeling that this urge of yours to type this disingenuous rubbish was triggered by the fact your chicken-feet resembling fingers are just feeling itchy."

"@@tinastroswitch7007 Again pointing out something and calling it what it is, which in this case is racism doesn't mean someone is stuck in the old apartheid days. So how your brain which seems to be the size of a grape seed process it that way is just as unknown as who is actually your father. You will have to be a twenty four / seven basement dwelling neanderthal oblivious to what is out there in the real world if you fail to acknowledge that racism is still very much alive today despite the fact that ""apartheid"" was abolished 26 years ago. Your reluctance to admit that this Clicks' advert has those facets of apartheid where a white person is portrayed as being a superior race while a black/coloured person is conversely shown to be inferior, just indicates how wet behind your ears you still are on this subject matter. And no matter how much I try to drum how racist the ad was into your thick skull, it will enter one ear and leave out of the other in an instant. So basically trying to get you to understand this is just as much of a mission impossible as expecting your overweight self to lay off the hot dogs. I don't give two squirts of piss which music you listen to nor did I ask you to provide me with such unsolicited information so the point you are desperately trying to make here remains blurred with no hope of it becoming ultimately clear. I wouldn't be surprised if you are cut from the cloth of parents who worked in cahoots with the apartheid government to snitch on their own kind during a time where loyalty to your own people determined whether you would live to see tomorrow."

"No,this is bs now! Yes I admit that Clicks made a huge mistake for doing that and they definitely need to sort these kind of problems so that they don't appear again in the future. As for EFF to destroy Clicks store that my mom,dad,sister, brother,neighbour works at is totally unfair and selfish. They get big fat cheques by sitting in the parliament while we as citizens of this country have to work our butts off to contribute to the economy and provide for our families. No,this is total bs and I wonder where police officers were,oh! Who am I kidding? They are also controlled by this bloody corrupt government!"
"@Red Carded But this is going to affect everyone because of few people who did this and that's bad,nobody deserves to suffer for another person's actions"
"@Andrê Visser well,you can't defend the rubbish that Clicks has done, it's very wrong and discriminatory. All I'm saying is that the way in which the situation was handled was a little bit too far, immature and I'm worried about the children who saw this incident. Says a lot about the example that the so called leaders are setting."
"@Andrê Visser and I don't mean to be rude to you,you are absolutely right that thin hair is very problematic for people's hair of your colour. The only anger people have here is that we buy hair products for our Afros mostly at Clicks,since they make them and sell them at affordable prices and yet now call our natural hair dull,dry and drizzle. That's an insult on it's own,then it was worse when they compare it with the type of hair you guys have(of which it was also insulting for you too). All in all,Clicks was very wrong and did that on purpose but now the way in which the situation is handled puzzled me"
"@Andrê Visser I hear you but they blew it all by saying and Afro is this and then silky hair is that. Honestly speaking, it's very offensive for me because I have an Afro as my natural hair and buy my hair products at this pharmacy,so defending it makes it worse as Clicks is now paying for their recklessness. We live in a diverse country and things such as these are very sensitive, Clicks could have thought about that before advertising it."
"@Andrê Visser South Africa comes a very long way and apartheid era is the root of all of what's going on. People are very angry and can no longer tolerate racist acts whereby you feel like you have to pay the sins due to your skin colour. Nobody forced them to advertise this kind of thing,they could have just left it because whoever did this missed the point of what an advertisement is and how it should reflect to the audience. And this is not the end,it will occur again,might not be this. It's not right to feel like you don't belong to this country while you were born in it. If South Africa wants a change, it's time things are changed at every angle in this country. No human will eradicate racism but it shouldn't be something we tolerate as people of this country,in saying that,all I was saying is that this matter could have been handled in a more mature manner, vandalising the store will not solve the problem. To me,seems like EFF is just doing all this to earn more votes in the next year's elections."
"@Andrê Visser seems like you are fighting with me while the CEO of Clicks is also disappointed by this. Yes,apartheid ruled for more than 100 years and unfortunately nobody will ever reverse what happened but rather as citizens of this country transform this country to be inclusive for everyone. Stop defending a racist act because that won't change anything but rather create outrage and anger!"
"@Andrê Visser you will never understand our pain,so I better leave you😊"

Its failure to condemn Clicks advert is another smoking gun evidence that people of colour may use against it. Actually they have started doing so. There is definite irrefutable proof that DA panders for a certain group of people and unfortunately those people are a minority and that isn't how politics work. EFF , while their conduct was abhorrent and reprehensible, are a strategic party which captures what the masses interests are and use that to acquire more votes and traction. Most people of colour can relate to EFF'S manifesto while DA policies don't have this appeal."

It is the same way that ANC instills fear and feeling of uncertainty among the elderly by telling them that if you don't vote for ANC and another political party comes into power , you will kiss your old age grant goodbye. You and I both know that this is not true but as a politician you have to capture the masses' interest and capitalise on that even if it means misleading people. The purpose here is to earn votes and DA's failure to draft a manifesto which resonates with the majority will cost it a shit-load of votes. When this happens you are allowing EFF which is the 3rd biggest political party in the country to replace DA as an opposition party. The big question is who is worth voting for? To be honest no one and this situation of not having a party that you can vote for is another reason why ANC will always be in power."

I think our image of the EFF as being canny manipulators is a bit exaggerated by the fact that they came up during Zuma's administration, when getting people to side with you simply by opposing Zuma was so easy that even the DA could do it. They are now in a bind because they don't have a hell of a lot to offer. Apart from ""the land,"" which the ANC is doing anyway, their only unique policy positions this year are advocacy for extending level 5 lockdown for a year (highly unpopular), and having open borders to the rest of Africa (highly unpopular). Their supporters seem to be on the one hand desperate people ignorant of their policies, and on the other hand overeducated ideologically possessed twits. I'm far from saying that they are not a threat, I was sounding the warning bells years ago when most people were still laughing. But it doesn't seem like the voters they are contending for could be contested by any party with reasonable or practical proposals. The sole exception of a good EFF policy being decentralization via the use of SEZs, which is a good idea that's been floating around in the South African urban planning literature since the 1970s at least."

This means they didn't see anything wrong with it. That's where the problem is. PS: I do not condone what The EFF did.

"@@LesediSIBSON What ""real issue?"" That frizzy hair is frizzy, flat hair is flat, and thin hair is thin?

"@@wolfieinu that's exactly my concern, The 'it's just a fucking shampoo ad.' Y'all see just an ad, but to us it's the harsh reality that we're still racially opressed even after 26 years of democracy declaration.

But no they didn't, because it's who they are and that's what they believe"
"@@LesediSIBSON I mean... the vast majority of people with frizzy hair are black, I don't know what to tell you. Similarly, as I recall, the ad showed light-haired white women's hair as being flat and thin, which is a concern for them. I fail to see how that's racist. Should whites of Northern/Germanic extraction be destroying Clicks stores because it's discriminatory against them to portray blonde hair as thin and flat, whereas Mediterranean hair is thicker and with more body? It's ridiculous. We know from reality what different kinds of hair look like. The irony is that people will destroy a shop one day for saying their hair is frizzy, and then the next day they will go buy hair straightener. Even they themselves also know mos"
"@@wolfieinu 'you don't see how that's racist' you're now being completely ignorant. They said black hair is dry and DAMAGED but blond hair is FINE and flat. The ad clearly perpetuates the white hair as superior only because of their skin colour and YOU DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S RACIST??? I personally liked our exchange of words until this point, you're deeming yourself stupid and undeserving attention to this matter because you're simply racist yourself"
"@@LesediSIBSON Well no, that's exactly it. ""Fine"" means that each strand of hair is thin, which can make you look bald.

"I saw the ad. Either the EFF is doing this for political gain and playing dumb or they do not understand what the ad is saying. NO WHITE WOMAN WANTS FINE FLAT HAIR. Fine here means thin in texture. It was comparing a white woman's normal hair with the problem of fine flat hair that some white women have and NOT comparing it to the hair of black woman. The ad was saying the exact same thing about white problem lack-luster hair as it was saying about black hair IF there is a problem. The white woman's hair looks horrible in the flat fine hair pic. NOT NICE FROM A WHITE POINT OF VEIW!! There was no racism in it at all, the aim was to be INCLUSIVE. What the ad was saying - no matter the problem, the product will fix it. In the case of the white woman it will give the hair body and fullness and strengthen it not to have such a fine texture and help it to look normal again. The EFF are making a laughing stock of themselves in the eyes of the world who understand the context. But they want to make political gain from it because they know their voters might not understand the context. They did not bother to check the meaning from a first language English point of view or if they did they are ignoring it for their own motives. The company that makes that hair product - TRESemmé has its headquarters in New York. The ad was most likely made there for first-language English speakers and sent all over the world as an international campaign.They know that fine flat hair will be understood as BAD by first-language English speakers. They did not realize it will be misunderstood in other countries where English was not the first language. It was an innocent oversight and no racism was intended. It was actually meant to be inclusive and accommodating of different races - the very opposite of what it is being accused of - simply because of ignorance of how English is used. Millions of people understand it the correct way where English is their first language. They did not realise that in Africa fine and flat could be understood as complimentary and praiseworthy while in fact it is speaking about a hair problem white woman want to find a solution for. So this is a language issue that the EFF are exploiting for their own gains pretending it is a racial issue. I hope South Africans that have fallen for this trick will realize they are being played as puppets by the EFF leaders. If they really misunderstood the English language, and did no checks, who could ever trust them to guide South Africa on the international stage."

You just displayed your ignorance by telling people to go to another pharmacy for their medication. It does not work like that.

"Sibelo, I assume you mean you want people to represent you who think force is the answer to lack of jobs, unreasonable demands for everything to be given for free. Please explain who will provide the funds for all these demands. Clicks is not a white owned company but is shareholder owned with majority black labour force and management. The ad that caused all the problem showed black hair that was dry and frizzy but it also showed a head of white hair that was thin and damaged ,was that racist. People need to think , gather facts before they rush off causing mayhem, destroying shops, product and peoples income, many of the people now not working because a political group wanted to make points from something and nothing. Not everything done is done with intent to insult or be racist. When will the demand come for Clicks to pay reparation and to which group ?? Do not try to defend people who make blatant racist threats on TV and threaten other companies they will be next. Last question why the steel chain which the gent had around his shoulders ???? Is that the new fashion or part of EFF UNIFORM . KEEP CALM ."

"It is embarrassing to see the standard of people who speak on behalf of these politicians. Think people they could one day be in power. Who was Mr. Big with the chief, the one with the chain hanging around his neck? Who wears a heavy chain on peaceful protest? No such thing here anymore. Our democracy abused every day , even in Parliament by people who make demands but never offer solutions. Will they be trusted with the future of this beautiful Country and that of our children. I pray not because they offer no solutions only more mayhem and lack of jobs , investments. They want a United Africa , one state ,one currency one leader. Who I wonder do they see in that position ?? There will never be an Africa that they envision, history shows this to be true. Stop looking to blame everyone for the state we are in and do something positive to build a Country which will be a light for the rest of Africa."

"There's a difference between protesting and closing stores. You have no right to close the store and if you start threatening employees and customers in order to do so, you are in fact then transgressing the interdict. All you can do is toi toi outside."
"You are right in your interpretation. But imagine if CLICK opened its stores, EFF members would enter and protest peacefully inside the malls but there are other people with different motives who would take advantage of this situation to vandalize and loot from the stores. Click stands to lose heavily in all ways. What are advocating for is just theoretical but in practice it can't be fullfilled."

"@@danielasante8245 Let's think about this objectively. Clicks is in business to sell products and make a profit which won't happen if they upset their customers - by this we can conclude that the advert was not very well considered but the point of the ad was to sell products so therefore offense was not intended. It's a myth that white people all have smooth, soft, shiny hair. Ask the clicks cashiers if white people also buy the hair relaxers etc. The point is that we can all CHOOSE to ignore perceived insults or not and we can also choose to be fooled by our controllers who fan the flames - or not."

"You are only commenting on damages! What about commenting on what incited the action of Afrikan people? So according to you it is ok to be racist, we must just sit and be ok?"
@UC9_ySHR_JTTiR600dV1kCvQ he has a point tho. Inciting violence is inherently evil and should always be avoided. Besides....

"As a South African I want to confirm that there are DEFINABLE tensions in the country, Malema is a liar, thief and racist. Malema needs to be careful, he could be the next political leader in SA that gets shot, it's a common thing with communists (or fascists) to be taken down. He only has 3-6% of votes. The media makes it look like he is important but all he does is steal from supporters to pay for crimes and big houses. Unfortunately people in South Africa don't understand what propaganda is. So when they decide have balls (which the EFF don't) they are always in groups and are afraid to be alone because they have few supporters. What do they think is going to happen at the end of all this? In South Africa 90% of the land is unoccupied, but instead of giving them the land they want to take what has already been built and bought, they don't create they destroy and steal and create imaginary problems. Malema owns multiple houses, cars etc but he doesn't buy any of his supporters houses or anything. Instead of arguing with the government (ANC) he needs another enemy like the Nazi's did with Jews. In this case it is white South Afrricans. Dear foreigners there is NO land issue. Just racism and politics. Our country is large and bountiful there is plenty of land to take. They just want to take from those who have bought land from the government (ANC) because they think all white people stole land. This is a falsehood as you have to buy it from the government. There is so much land but they refuse to work on it, instead they want to take what has already been built where they don't have to work. There are countless farms which were ""given""back that have failed miserably because they don't understand this difference between commercial farming and subsistence farming. Let me ask you this EFF members, if someone took your land that you bought from the government (ANC) and you had to give it up, would you leave it in pristine condition? Or would you destroy it all since they are taking it with no compensation. Don't be stupid farmers will pour black oil on their fields to get you back, then you will have useless land. Stop biting the hand that feeds you and go claim unoccupied land were you won't cause problems and you can contribute back into society instead of inciting violence, stealing, being racist and generally just causing a unhappy atmosphere for your children."

"Look.. Clicks was just pointing out that if you're going to imitate white people straight hair then you should do it the right way with proper cosmetics. You can say all you want, but it doesn't look natural when they try to imitate white people styles. Just don't call it racism. This ad was insensitive yes, i agree. But not racist"
Lol the marketing team was like don't worry a letter will fix all this😂 plan gone wrong ..
"Ad was offensive, agree, even though the manager of clicks is black himself. The issue is, the eff only promotes violence and segregation further, their actions do not help SA in any way. Issues like this need to be worked out in the correct forums. Eff constantly talks black vs white and violence. SA has no future, because it lives in its past."
Yes I agree it mean the country is still trying to kick back up again from this lock down.. and now this is wounder if the economy will change
Why discriminating eish
Thanks for sharing your hair curling sauce g
Wild🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️
Yah.. and the EFF don't play
So what your views on this
"As a person of colour I was deeply offended by this clicks advert but however the EFF's response was far from wise and was imprudent cause they should directly deal with those involved with the ad not the persons working at the stores. with an economy that has contracted by 51% due to the lockdown and facing the possibility of needy R3.4 trillion to recover, yet the EFF carelessly loot stores(It beats me to think that they're one of the main opposition in the country). Our current situation and the job market is self explanatory, however these politicians will go back home to a full meal where else ordinary people will be forced to suffer."
Yes that's true.. we the people will have to pay for what they destroyed and it will take months probably even a year for them to kick back again poor clicks
"It was very wrong i agree atleast let them fine ke,and keep the shops open. i'm worried about the jobs also eish!!"
People will not loose their jobs. Clicks is a million dollar corporations. If they do then they will anger EFF further
"I agree when you said EFF should redirect this offence somewhere else cuz there SOOOOOO MUCH MORE we need to work on as a nation. (Corruption from politicians, GBV, Illegal activity, poverty, protection of or natural resources, economic development, etc) This seems to be extremely petty and unethical behaviour because standing by the stores doesn't stimulate our growth as a nation."
Yes this is not something to make much noise while bigger things are happening nobody makes noise
@@TROY72602 read my examples
Clicks has long been problematic. This is not the first time that they have released racist adverts and have gotten away with them in the past.
Because of jobs then we need to leave such issues hanging and my child still find the same issues in future . EFF is right..
I am not going to argue with you about that
🤣🤣🤣 Look who is talking
You can have difference of opinion without attacking another person's character. The measure of intelligence is how well you can support your argument. You are clearly the stupid one that is not well educated if you attack someone personally. Stick to the topic at hand and back up your arguments with facts

"Wow way to be racist. Im as white as white can be and when I let my hair grow out long and naturally I was turned away from jobs also, but let me guess my hairs not ""natural"" cause what Im not a bipoc? how about stop saying its becouse your black and its the company is just discriminating? oh I know cause then you couldnt be the victom you want to be so bad. RACIST! I bet youy hate men and straight people too? Come on, people like you are breading new racists on both sides and keeping the old racism on life support. Good job hope you make lots of money and get all the validation you were looking for."
"Sister, you are awesome. You said it all. I am a poet and playwright in Harrisburg Pennsylvania with dreadlocks. I conducted interviews with black women and collected their stories of natural hair bias, health problems caused by relaxers and stress, and memories of microaggressions and translated them into poetry. I then crafted those stories into a choreopoem entitled HairStory: Reclaiming Our Crown. We are holding auditions on February 7th, 2023. The show will be performed at Gamut Theatre in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on May 4th - 7th and we are doing two shows for school kids on the 9th and the 10th. This is such an important issue of inequality and prejudice. I wanted to, like you say, educate the public about it. My sword in this fight is poetry. We are looking for panelists and speakers for our talkback. We are also seeking sponsors. If you'd like to be involved, please contact Mary James, President of the Harrisburg PA Chapter of the Links, Incorporated at linkmj47@comcast.net. Thank you for all the work you are doing!"

"Million Dollar Income Potential in Ruvol I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS. I called it “RUVOL.” Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” Why am I so sure about this? Because I am an avid chess player myself. I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they could even play against opponents blindfolded. It is for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. Since Ruvol is yet “unpublished,” I am extra careful in fully disclosing how it is exactly played, lest it might be “plagiarized.” The “BEST PREVIEW” I can give, more than enough to appreciate how the game is played, is as follows: 1. Ruvol is almost somewhat played like chess. [I invented Ruvol primarily to give chess a direct “apple-to-apple” competition.] 2. Like chess, Ruvol is a board game for two players. 3. If the chess board is square in shape containing 64 squares in all, the Ruvol board is rectangular with more number of squares in it. 4. If each chess player has 16 pieces, each Ruvol player has same number of pieces as well. 5. If each type of chess piece moves in a distinct way, the Ruvol types of pieces move in distinct ways, too. 6. If to win the chess game requires tactical skills or strategic thinking, the more the Ruvol requires of it. 7. If the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is entirely different but far more exciting and challenging. In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world. These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe. At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$4 billion. Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale is US$40M. I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL. For the reason that I don’t have enough resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it “wiser” to simply sell my copyright. If you are interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER—[the copyright goes to the highest bidder]. My email address is: rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com. Thanks and God bless.

"Honestly when I saw the ad I thought that they were just describing the different hair types that there are and they have products to combat those conditions. I didn't really notice the colour of the woman paired with the descriptions until it was pointed out to me. I am white and my hair is frizzy and dull. I think for most woman fine and flat is not a compliment - most woman want volume and full bodied hair, again I saw it as a description of a hair condition and Tresemme was obviously communicating that they have a product specifically to combat flat and fine hair. The same as when you purchase skincare products, oily skin, dry skin and normal skin. I know some might think I'm ignorant but the truth is I was not raised in a racist home and I for one just saw four different descriptions of hair conditions (like when buying products for your skin, dry, oily, normal, normal to dry etc)"
White ladies can't have damaged hair but black women have...that's what they believe.
"I dont understand. The wording on the white woman's hair stated she had "" fine and flat"" hair. The word ""fine"" can have 2 meanings. ""Fine"" like in ok, or ""fine"" like in it had no body. Obviously this is what was meant in this context. So all the fuzz was about one word which was completely misunderstood?"
Tresseme products have bn removed from store shelves. This is so unfair.....
"Fine, and flat hair is not a compliment either. I know girls with fine, and flat hair, and they complain a lot about it, while I complain about my dry, and damaged hair. The hair relaxer really damage my hair, but if I don't use it, my hair gets so hard, I can't get a comb through it, without a lot of pain. So, the advert made me aware, that I should make time to give my hair oil treatments as well. I see absolutely nothing wrong with the ad, but girls, and women with low self-esteem, and a hair complex, will always take everything about hair, personal. Sad. What people should do, is just not buy from Clicks, and make their own products. What a good idea I got, because of the ad. I'm gonna check out, how to make my own beauty products. No more dry, and damaged hair for me. And, no more relaxer either. Maybe I just need oil treatments, and I have a lot of sunflowers in my garden. I wonder!"
"No one is supposed to be looking at skin here, it's an add about hair regardless of the person it belongs to, would anyone have said anything if the roles were reversed, I doubt it, people should get better hobbies than trying to find racism. People like that are keeping us all behind. All lives matter."
wait to you see some other ads that really confuse you . You have 2 sunscreen sachet products ... one a clicks product and another which is super crap giving you skin rash . Wonder how much the buyer at clicks gets a under the table kickback . I now refuse to buy any sunscreen for my club in Durban !!
"One glance tells you it was wrong....! Tresemme doesn't even have products that cater for black hair so how dare they even compare hair they know nothing about. I'm further disappointed by Clicks because, as an ex-loyal customer I used to admire their hair care aisle because it has the widest variety of ethnic hair products and alot of them are local brands. I'm taking a break from them and shopping from Dischem."

I think you guys at click should have put a black model at the bottom of that ad with straight hair... that wouldn't have been a problem...

No one is supposed to be suspended or fired. The useless eff must stop there shit and except the truth. What do they say - The truth herts
Simple solution don't put people in your advertisement. Just use the product you are selling in your adverts. Why do we need people in adverts we all know what shampoo is. We all have heads. Think of the money you will save by not using people in advertising and pass the saving onto your customers.

"A real CEO, can hear in his speech. Thank you Sir"
"how did they post the advert without actually seeing it? I dont know why eff is protesting, just encourage people not to support clicks/tresseme products that's it!!"

Oh man story of my white life 🤭

"All this could have been avoided . Especially with Digital Marketing expanding the way it is, organizations should ensure they are equipped.

"Looks more like 1961 advertising, who does such thing in this day and age."
"It wasn't racist. Should I shout racist because straight, flat hair was mentioned? Really clicks?? Maybe we should shout racist when omo is advertised. This is pathetic."
"frizzy and dull hair is considered damaged and flat straight hair is considered healthy. Most black women has frizzy hair, most white women has straight hair. i don't know any white women with frizzy hair, so what's the problem with the ad?"
"Nope, flat straight hair is not considered normal.... White woman like to have bouncy shiney styled hair. Must I call clicks racist now?"
Fine and flat isn't really attractive though. Having fine (thin and easily breakable) hair is a hassle for me at least because it's not as strong. Flat hair you can't do much when it comes to nice bounce and waves because it ends up falling flat. So it's not really attractive.
I should ask this that is RSA independent yet.
Clicks is now my favourite shop.

"I guess they should have used black vs indian or Brazilian hair then blacks wouldn't have been so angry after they love those hair, Blacks are hypocrites, it is us as a black culture that say there is something wrong with our hair then when someone points it out then its racists, please blacks let's look at ourselves first, We hide our hair with weaves"

"Why are the EFF protestors not adhering to COVID-19 regulations, as they are not adhering to social distancing and wearing of masks?"
"Yep your company needs to reflect at every level the communities you serve,oversight is required so we don't find ourselves here again,but that's what happens when you undermine true diversity,you end up with team members that can't relate to the communities they work with 'cos they only see things from one racial perspective."
"Good interview though ,but I fail to understand what was in the mindset of those who approved the advert ...why didnt they go against this advert before it goes out of control.is amazing how most gets away with condoning this type of adverts"
"I have been a loyal fan of Tresemme shampoo and conditioners, I dont c myself ever buying their products ever again."
"It's is really painful to see that post, why would some one do such a thing????"
"The interviewer does a great job, no bias. The CEO is saying the thingz we want to hear, nothing special. Now we need action taken to the quality assurance team. Thanks to the EFF for standing up. This is why am done with ANC."
Get used to it...

Clicks is facing the consequence of racism, Zimbaqwe suffered from a revenge impact, We are all matured, the choice is PERSONAL"

And make a point of going ot of their way to spite white folks any way they can. Yet odly these politicians rubs shoulders with all sorts of dodgy rich white folk from other countries and that seems OK because it makes them rich.

It is infered fron the picture. The add never actually said anything racist
Bullshit. What is non-racial supposed to mean? Fail to notice the skin colour of a shoulder and all hell breaks loose?
''Fine and flat hair'' isn't complimentary either. People are just being mislead by the word ''fine'' which is not at all a positive way to describe hair. I believe their intention was equal representation by using both a black and white model . Except they got it wrong by using good looking models - both of whom don't have '' bad'' hair - just so their photo's would look fab with their brand. Let this be a lesson to them (Tresemme and Clicks) to stop false advertising and use REAL people next time
White ladies do not like fine and flat hair. They like volume and thick hair. And that is a blond. So we blonds are discriminated against.
"Then tell them to show a freezy dull shaggy blond and compare with a flat hair blonde not to use an African simple, why do they have use An African to show a bad thing"
"What you do not know is there are a lot of frizzy haired white people. Just like I said. We al pay hundreds for looking good. And why can't black people be models. They paid that model a lot of money. Or should black people not show their beauty. You get the most beautiful black prople and they could be models. Now you say no take black people of.

Again, ppl are selective in what they deem correct. Almost seems as if they are ""paid"" to do certain things. If any of you think the eff are in your corner, you got another thing coming. This for the EFF and any politcal party is a way of gaining public favor, nothing more. It it not the dream of most woman to have long flowing straight hair? Look at this link, check out the image, and you will see, that even Julius Malema appreciates long straight hair. https://www.bona.co.za/mantwa-and-julius-malema-celebrate-their-third-wedding-anniversary/ Take a 30 minute walk through any African city, and you will see how many ""black"" woman want long flowing straight hair. So they would rather adorn themselves with someone elses long straight black hair by wearing a weave, than buying a product that can offers to get there own hair straight and shiny LOL. Comon man ppl, get off your high horse, there are more pressing matters to attend to. The EFF wants all Clicks stores to close for so many days, what happens after that? Can anybody tell me what is going to happen after Clicks closes its doors for a few days? Will that make things better again? To Julius Malema, show yourself here, show the people how you stand for them. Take your members and protest, protest against corruption, looting of coffers for all the billions lost during the past 20 odd years. SHOW US EFF that you stand for the people."

"I think people should protest against Tresemme' instead of Clicks. Sure Clicks buggered up by posting such a racist ad, but Tresemme' themselves developed it and were completely insensitive to how such an ad would be received. Completely offensive. I won't be using Tresemme' anymore. Time to switch brands! I also think Clicks senior management have thrown the junior employees under the bus. They should be suspended as they will have approved this terrible ad."
Jagfan hilton u are part of solution big up
"@Mister educator , ""more grown up & understanding""??? How do you as a company create an ad that incites white attributes trump black attributes in an enviroment that has pre-existing racial tensions. I think the ad was a blunder, thats my view from a markering perspective; 1.) it doesn't connect with the audience 2.) the message is controversial"
"The problem isn't white or black. The problem is South African's. Both sides are racist and until they sort their rubbish out and accept each other, peace will never return. The young generation is doing it right. Look at all these relationships and friendships between people of different colours. They are the key. The old generation and politicians are causing the problems, because the new generation are working well together. It's due time we get some modern people in charge. Why do we put people who have gone through the terror of apartheid in charge. They have negative stigma and will all have grudges and problems they are trying to rectify for themselves for old time sake. They will never have that inner peace to run the country. It's time we put the new generation, who have been raised together, to lead us together. Instead of the old generation, leading us segregated. ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻✊"

"Many years ago I worked for Sentula Mining in Woodmead and one day I decided to let my hair free. I had the most amazing huge fluffy bun and was so proud of it. When I walked into the office; the finance director who was very racist was shocked. I said: ""Nice hey."" and she said she didn't think black hair was nice. But that company had a lot of racist issues that were detrimental to my career eventually. What's scary is that the legal system in South Africa makes it so difficult to prove racism. They don't see it unless its what they have written in their books."

"The person who made the advertisement is clearing oblivious to the whole race thing. Maybe in that way the person who set up the advertisement ain't racist, and sees everyone as equal so didn't see a problem including two different people of colour. However, it could be racist intentions as well. Or not, we will never know. What we do know, is the person setting up the advert is clearly stupid . How did they not think this would upset people and cause a stir. Do they not get people to proof read? Just by looking at it, you know it is going to cause trouble. They must be punished for causing this chaos. Additionally, all the people breaking down Clicks shops and attacking it's employees, should be charged. How is this matter of protesting correct? This is just damaging and won't help solve the problem. This is a part of our country's problem. This just shows our country will never come right. We are too violent and silly to ever solve things and prevent problems like this."
"You make a good point, I cannot imagine in this day and age how such an advertisment could see the light of day. Unless the creators involved are utterly out of touch and retarded, or creating a well rehearsed race drama. I am leaning toward the latter."
"The fact is you have no right to destroy property that does not belong to you. Civilised people don't do that.it is not racist to correct someone who is wrong, irrespective of race ,language, religion.

Eff, continually make statements calling for the white minority to be attacked and killed... where is the outrage from black South Africans ?? blatant racism from black leaders is ignored"
Easy for a raciist to pick hairs.
"It's not about the advert it's the blatant disregard for black identity, I'm sure your the type of person who puts on a black accent when you say dumb jokes. If your white Afrikaaner minority genuinely wanted those blacks to stand up for them they would at least show some empathy towards their causes and outcries in order for the favor to be returned. Because this generation have woken up to the fact that the white upper class is the one that enabled Mandela and the ANC to rule this country on a path of termoil while the remnants of the British empire truly ""captured"" the state for their own benefit. Wake up and smell the coffee because even after everything that has happened in the past we still don't hate your people the way you think because if we did you would get at least a sample of the treatment the black refugees get every now and then."

It's crazy to me that the junior stuff members got suspended with immediate effect but the senior members who actually approved the whole advert are still being investigated 🙄
That's what confuses me also!!

For your information I personally watch youtube videos on black hair...natural black hair and women with longer hair then me. I admire all races. This ad was blown out of proportion. The white ladies hair was described as fine and flat. That's not a compliment. I seriously did not see anything wrong with the ad. Every race ...when it comes to hair has issues with frizz and dry brittle hair. I have frizzy dry hair coz I dyed it. Its hair....it can change with hair products. This is no reason for EFF to be destructive and close clicks stores down. Do you realise that majority of the workers are non white. What will happen to the employees. ...think about it.

We end raising young girls who are not confident with their own hair 💔. But let's agree to disagree Anya ❤️"

"@Mister Educater Wow look who's coming off as a racist now 😂, do you man. And since you know black people so well there's no need for me to have a conversation with you because you already know how I feel boss."
"Then clearly the only people that was not racist was the people that made the advert because it did not even cross their minds. Does everyone have to tip toe on race so the political ""evils"" can't be exploited?"
black hair is more fragile than Caucasian hair its scientific fact its not racist ...hair products producers knows this as its scientific facts why is facts offensive? if its true its true ...common get real getting bullied by the ANC ....im white i have flat long hair now im offensive to me being white ...BBE is a racist ANC Government is offensive
"Saying another ethnic group has “dry damaged hair “ whilst saying another has “ fine and flat hair“ is offensive and absolutely racist. No it’s not a fact, no it’s not scientific evident. Dont use science to justify racism."
"Manuela Manzambi you misunderstand, it’s not saying one ethnic group has dry and damaged hair and the other doesn’t it’s saying the girl at the top has dry and damaged hair and the girl at the bottom doesn’t. Execution came off as a bit racist but overall message was not."
You are an id'iot lady... Look up DOMINANT TRAITS vs RECESSIVE TRAITS and see what science ACTUALLY says about who has the weaker brittle hair. 😂😂
"Moshpit animation, so you’re saying the advert is comparing one girls hair to another and race has absolutely nothing to do with it? If that’s case why is the African hair dull and damaged whilst the European hair fine and flat? If it was a true comparison wouldn’t it have been better to compare an African hair to another African hair Or a European hair to another European? The fact that it was compared against races makes it racist! Even the ceo just admitted to the ad being racist. If the ad was as normal as you’re saying we wouldn’t be here having both clicks and tressemme issuing an apology."
Manuela Manzambi I said the execution came off as racist but the overall message was not which is why I don’t see it as that big of a deal
"@@manuelamanzambi3811 fine and flat isn't ""Wow! Beautiful! Perfection!"" No fine is extremely thin breakable hair. Flat is having no volume, no bounce. It's not a compliment. Unless you want them, I have plenty of fine and flat hair and I'd love for it to be strong and bouncy instead"
And ladies from all colors can have damaged hair
All lives matter😂
"@@mzansiproduction7227 Neh? 😂 😂 ""I don't see colour"" 😂 😂 😂"
Answer is ladies with damaged hair white or black should ignore this racial ad
"LOOK AT CONTEXT !! In the world of shampoos -the words FINE and FLAT mean something different . FINE Hair is NOT desirable because it means VERY THIIN HAIR ."" FLAT "" hair means hair that has NO bounce or volume and needs FIXING ! Shampoos everywhere in all brands try to CORRECT this state and make hair NORMAL -ie full of volume and bounce instead of flat - this was INTENDED meaning NOT to say the WHITE woman's hair was NORMAL and the black hair was ABNORMAL . That is why no one on the team saw a problem with AD - TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING"

EFF SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED IN COSMETIC STUFF. HOW DOES POLITICS AND HAIR STUFF CROSS PATHS. HE'S A MAMPARA. GO SAVE SOUTH AFRICA JULIAS.
you're right. there are more important things to discuss
Racism is political
@@letsunite8164 Racism has always been there. But hair...Nobody chose how they want to look. Looks don't matter but character does.
"First. Racism is obviously a problem and as a united S.A. we should always stand against it. White, black, coloured, indian, asian... We all experience racism towards us in different ways (expecially in SA) and it is good when we stand together against it. Second. When the photo was originally made. I can promise you it was innocent. (Go look at the advert, most people don't even know what the advert looks like) Clicks is a level 2 BEE company. This means that almost everyone who works there is black. In fact, it was revealed that the marketing team who made the photo was multiracial and the manager who approved it was of coloured decent. There is no doubt in my mind that this photo was never intended to be racist. So why are people freaking out about it? 2 reasons: First we must understand the underlying psychological nature of racism. It is like a ""plant"" that grows within peoples minds. Whenever arguments occur (like the one about clicks) people are forced to focus on race & think of racial issues. They are forced to choose sides & found their believes in the various narratives placed around them in order to reach closure. This process inevitably waters the ""plant"" of racism within us, allowing racism to spread and grow. In other words, by making a ""fuss"" over what was inherently a innocent advert. Everyone is now forced to contemplate the advert in a racial way. And they are now convinced the advert was a racial attack and they feel hurt. It is like when a young daughter wants to always sit on her fathers lap. It is sweet and innocent until somebody makes a digusting/inappropriate comment. Suddenly the whole room is forced to feel uncomfortable, and we are forced to look at a innocent act in a dark way. So where am I getting at? Well... The point that I want to reach is that nobody would've even bothered to consider the advert as a racial attack, if people were not so racially obsessed in the first place. This psychological phenomena is unfortunately fuelled by the various politcal narratives parties like the ANC, EFF, FV+ and recently the DA always use to gather voters. And now we reach the second reason... The EFF has hijacked the narrative to do some good old fashioned sheep farming. The EFF gathers the majority of its voters (the sheep) by enflaming and prodding feelings of race and identity in order to manipulate them. Once the EFF has sufficiently made people upset enough. The EFF provides a narrative that gives false closure (remember what I wrote above) and promotes the political agenda that makes them look good. It will always feed a narrative along the lines of: ""There is a oppressor (usually whites but sometimes indians or asians) who seeks to harm and steal from the innocent & oppressed (in this case often black people). All others (ANC, DA, corporations, etc) are in league with the oppressors & are traitors and cannot be trusted. Only we can be trusted ( the EFF). You can only vote for us if you want justice."" The above example is a classic manipulation strategy that has been used by almost all dictators in the past to wrestle for power. In fact. It is exactly what hitler did to come into power. Hitler had a narrative like this: ""There is a oppressor (Jews, non-arians, communists) who seeks to harm and steal from the innocent & oppressed (in this case the true german people, the arians). All others (politcal parties, countries, corporations, etc) are in league with the oppressors & are traitors and cannot be trusted. Only we can be trusted ( the nazis). You can only vote for us if you want justice."" Malema does step for step what every dictator of the past has done for power. But he does not care about the people... The EFF was silent and showed poor leadership in these past times with corona virus, the vbs money they stole, corruption, and the well justified protests by coloured people on their political treatment. And now that the 2021 elections are around the corner, they do the same classic sheep farming they have done since the party was founded. So this is the second reason people are upset. They are being manipulated by a cunt in a red hat for some cheap and easy votes"

@@asandamkhonto7309 we will never be taken seriously
"Fact is, predominantly white women suffers from frail soft flat hair, not black woman. Fact is predominantly black women suffers with dry damaged hair, to a lesser extend white woman as well. With both white and black woman you will also find good healthy hair. The advert focused on different hair types found on different ethnic types. They offer a solution for different types of problems. That’s the facts. Both white and black woman do a lot of damage to their hair trying to achieve a specific style or color. White woman by dying their hair and black woman with products such as relaxers etc. Why keeping the EFF aside now? Julius took the matter in his own hands using it as a political tool for all the wrong reasons. Did he or any EFF member or supporter look at the long term implications of the action? If Clicks has to close down who will suffer the most? The majority of the workforce is non white people! So is this in anybody’s good interest? So people like me have a long way to go in this country? Nope, I think you got it all wrong. If an advert of any kind on any platform cause any form of sorrow or injustice by implication the affected person(s) can go to the advertising board and lay a formal complain. That is what they are therefore. This is not even a place or a platform for any political party to get involved with. But as usual, here in SA, when common sense and logic is absent the old rusted worn out race card is played."

"@@shivavuyani not crazy at all. What was advertised, was the different types of shampoos. We as women ALL have one of those types, no matter our race. I don't see white South africans being offended by a white woman being used for ""fine and flat"" hair = having thin hair. In these times we live in, where people get so easily offended, the marketing staff SHOULD have realised how this could go down, and should have perhaps used an indian / coloured women under ""normal"" hair type. It was an error in judgement, with no racist intent. The marketing team consist of 2 Africans, 2 whites, one coloured, so should they ALL be fired? I really don't think so."

"@@shivavuyani, the advert is not calling African hair ""dry and damaged"" or ""frizzy"", they could just as well have used white hair to advertise the shampoos available for ""dry and damaged"" and ""frizzy"" hair shampoos, heck, they could have used mine for both, throw in their for ""oily"" hair and mine could be used for that too (crazy hair I have). I do not believe for a second the intent was racism, even Clicks mixed race marketing team were ok with the advert, a huge error on their part, but not a racist one. Tresemme do not even cater for African hair (which we have to agree on, is nothing like white hair, it's beautiful, and what I call ""angel"" hair), so their attempt to include Africans to be inclusive, to avoid being racist, was an absolute flop. As I mentioned in my above comment, they really should have used an Indian or coloured woman's hair for their ""normal"" shampoo. I am not saying the advert is ok, as they REALLY should have realised how offensive it could be, but I do not think it deserved the reaction it received, nor do I think their marketing team / head of should be fired. Clicks apologised, am sure the advert was removed, they will no longer even be stocking and selling Tresemme products. Trashing and looting stores, intimidating staff and shoppers, is unacceptable behaviour, far worse than the ridiculous advert. Why not instead concentrate on the REAL issues happening in South Africa? The millions stolen, the children and women being raped and murdered, farmer attacks (not just white, many African farmers are being attacked too), homelessness, people starving, These are REAL issues to deal with. I would have far more respect for EFF if they chose to tackle these issues that desperately need sorting."

"@ the reason why people are triggered (mainly black people, is because this advert was very controversial. Our hair means a lot to and it has a lot history. During colonization and slavery black people were told to cut their hair or cover it up, we were told our hair was ugly and dirty. Then years later when relaxers were invented black people were told to relax their hair because straight hair is beautiful and coily, curly or kinky hair is ugly. To some people we are overreacting and being irrational, but if anyone had to go through the type of oppression that we went through and still going through, no one would be saying what they are saying. We are usually disrespectful and humiliated. Nobody knows the pain black people go through, having to love a world that deosnt love you back, having to live our lives in fear because we are afraid of judgment, having to wake up in a world where no one has respect for you, constantly deal with racial discrimination, having being constantly told that you are not beautiful, having to feel like you are not human and not knowing where you belong. We have been through so much just to be silent. Black people will no longer continue to live in fear or silence. I get where you are coming from, maybe it was not meant to be offensive but how are black people expected to react after being through all this pain. We are told colonization is over but we continue to live with the after effects. There is colorism, some black people are still living in poverty due to the lack of education or lack of opportunities. A lot black people were used to relaxing their hair now that we are realizing that our hair is beautiful, some people want to portray our hair as damaged, that is unacceptable, we cannot accept being disrespected anymore. It is easy for you to say it wasn't meant to be offensive because you are not Black. No one has ever victimized, even a portion of what we go through or what we have been through. EFF is angry about all the things white people have done to us, one big example is the killing of 10 million people by the cruel king Leopold, or the police brutality in the US. This is the uprisings of Black people and we are saying NO MORE to all of this bullshit. I respect your opinion but there's always an origin to everything, you can never find a tree without roots."

Black people are sensitive. They have a complex about their hair. It's a sensitive topic. Plus EFF looks for reasons to bring up the racist card. Not knowing it's their behaviour that's barbaric.
the adjectives used were not fair considering it was a marketing campaign. nice try. but these people aren't kids. they're grown adults that get paid to make people want their product. they failed and are being racist dude. if anyone lacked intelligence the people in charge of marketing did. besides who sells a product by tearing someone down? why not associate your product with their ideal beauty standards? also don't insult people. that negative energy doesn't help

We living in tough and very sensitive times of which we have to tip toe around conversations, topics, race and etc. In my opinion they were to make the AD do comparisons of say healthy And Unhealthy hair of all races that makes South Africa united. So I can see how some will have looked at it and say but why is it that in two different examples the same person has sort of bad hair. But it’s good to have a healthy and progressing dialogue while also teaching people to be mindful. Maybe the panel at clicks who are black has good hair and it’s maybe they didn’t see how it might offend majority of people as it was not a uniting factor having such an AD but for the consumer it would make sense. I also think some black woman like their hair as Afro, Dred or just natural so it’s a choice of which an AD such as that will trigger people.

Clearly someone is scared to give opinions. Idk how my imagination became a problem when we both know that those images shouldn't have been posted.

@@raymondglad5593 fair enough. I'm trying to reason with very little information. No amount of perspective reasoning will justify the racism in this ad.
@@thebeardedastronaut black hair is natural being fat is not and just as a word of advice don't say that in front of people they will be offended in the same way so many are offended by the ad
@@slicexl9283 this is a ploy to divide the people .
"@@jojoey1.113 You walk down the street and a person seems to stare at you. What is that person thinking? You have so many perspectives to consider and it is all going to be what is going on in your own head. That this has turned to racism is really sad and that it is blown out of proportion for political gain and dividing a nation is even more saddening. Why do we even choose to be angry about this add. read thru the arguments, people make choices of how they like to see it. I find it heart warming that some people made an add without even thinking about it as being racial. That's my choice and in 50 years from now people go to look back on this and think how stupid people where. I have watched my kids playing with black kids, they touch each others hairs and give perspective of what they think in total innocents, Giggle and carry on playing together. Now as you who is the racist? Who is causing the issues?"
@@raymondglad5593 I hear you. It's just that we are not living in a time where we can say let's make an advert and not think about race. The advert stated that black hair is dry and damaged while white hair isn't. Like I've said before all types of hair gets dry and damaged. Doing before and after shots of each women wouldn't have cause this reaction. Why can't you see how this causes anger. Why are you quick to dismiss this insensitivity that comes across as racist. How is me pointing this out making me racist and most of all damaging to you? I don't even know what you look like. And I'm being racist towards you??? Why is my opinion on black people being assertive and fighting for equality making you feel threatened? (not dismissing vandalism of the stores which is wrong) I'm all for peaceful protests & boycotts. But how does this make me racist? This is what happens when people fight for equality in society regardless of race. Things get broken in order for restructure. This does not take away your rights.
"Or maybe, just maybe, people need to grow a thicker skin and not literally burn down shops in an economic crisis because of an advertisement, taking away jobs from the same black people they claim to be looking out for"
"@@HimothyHimsworthy peaceful protest are the way forward. The EFF could've shown the same level of energy against corruption, gender based violence, farm murders, unemployment and so many other issues. Don't be quick to dismiss the racism in the advert because of people's reactions. Vandalism isn't the way forward and neither is dismissing racism by growing Thicker skin. Non black people need to grow thicker skin to deal with black and brown people stepping up and being more assertive about racism and taking up important spaces in society just like everyone else. Again I'm not saying vandalism is okay. But also, maybe just maybe you should grow thicker skin. Doesn't feel nice right."
"ghosted 1.1 my problem is more with people making mountains out of anthills, and I’m not saying you’re not allowed to be angry or annoyed when being discriminated against but it’s becoming all to common that people are unwilling to take a step back and say that we overreact over unimportant stuff when in this country alone we have bigger problems"
ghosted 1.1 but I guess my point is just I’m tired that so much energy can be focused on something that is so trivial when human trafficking is happening right now as we speak
"@@HimothyHimsworthy there other many other problems happening right now. I agree with you. However, this should not take away from the fact that we still have insensitive advertising that comes across as racist especially in South Africa. The EEF was very wrong in saying ""attack"" the clicks stores. And used people's anger to cover up that party leaders were in close proximity to the looting of the VBS bank. It was wrong. Just don't dismiss the racism in the advert because of this. Don't dismiss people's feelings. It's hurtful."
Controversy sells they say. It's on purpose.
"@@jojoey1.113 You choose to be angry because of your own thoughts, not facts. The only person you control in this world is yourself and that includes your emotions. No where did I say you are being racist to me and nor will I be offended if you even where. I don't even know what race you are nor do I care as I am speaking to a person with a view point that I differ from. I am not even fighting with you. I am showing you there is other ways to think. You do not need to break anything down for restructure. If people want racism to go act above it, Idiots that practice racism needs a reaction and you providing it. As I told my child that was upset with another person, if you a worker in a mental institute are you going to be upset with your patients all the time? There are just people out there you have no control off. So peaceful protest in the mental institute is not going to work, acting dignified might just."
"@@raymondglad5593 ""Now as you who is the racist, who is causing the issue"". You speculate my opinions on the matter to be creating racist issues. No trading store would ever want to anger their customers. Both yourself and the clicks marketing team did not pay attention to the racial insensitivity of saying black hair is ""dry and damaged"" because it seemed insignificant. At least clicks realized this. Even though our country's passed may make you uncomfortable take it into consideration on this matter. Race relations on TV requires cultural sensitivity and is not an inconvenience nor is it insignificant. This is what happens when we choose perspectives of ignorance, we end up with content that should not have been made and posted causing feelings of anger. Which was taken advantage of by the EFF. Why do you think so many absurd and wrongful farm murders are happening? Because choosing certain ""perspectives"" to dismiss our country's history/reality makes people feel wronged and resentful. Anger that is constantly dismissed. See what certain ""perspectives"" leave you with?? Sad situations that could have been avoided."
"@@jojoey1.113 Ok then you be angry. Feel wronged and resentful. The EFF has achieved there goals. They can continue their division strategy with the ANC that aids them looting and stealing from and the real victims, the poor."
@@raymondglad5593 It's odd how you choose to formulate opinions on the circumstances surrounding the advert then dismiss the kickback by focusing on not knowing the clicks teams insights and people's over reaction to racism. Why do you not formulate an opinion on the insensitivity coming across as racist in advert. Why? I hope your child does not take on your internalized racism and takes on a better perspective. We know the EFF is being opportunistic we know that they preach hate and It is very wrong. But you do understand why the party has supporters and why their members are so upset. Why can't you find a balance while formulating opinions on the party. Instead of discrediting their cause for achieving equality for all? No opinions on EFF priorities like black empowerment and land reform. Where is did that positive perspective go though.

It must be so satisfactory to identify a racist and show them close the shop and destroy . now when you finished with clicks look at the vegetable shops. You know they allow bananas to go black when they are old and ripe and then disposed of . If they turned white they would not do that.

"4:11 Actually, the BLM movement reinforced the stereotypes further and locked them in such a way that it's irreversible now. Even Patrisse Cullors got $90 million that was meant for black communities and she spent it on herself and nobody said a word. Black america is now the living breathing stereotype of itself as a result and you can add submissiveness to the white massa to the equation. Even Biden told black people to vote for him ""Or you ain't black"" and there was no pushback for him saying such a racist statement. He played the massa role and black america obliged. BLM didn't do anything except swindle itself in front of the world and prove that BL's never M'ed. Just look at the videos of all the shootings in Chicago and the mass looting in California. You'd be hard pressed to see any white people in those videos. The footage doesn't lie."

"Mass Media is primarily a Business. The media revolves around stereotypes. Pick any group and stereotypes are forefront. Many times folks, of all types, will adopt a stereotype as their own existence. Too many folks consume too much mass media. On the other end of the spectrum folks splinter into very specific consumers of niche media. Media that tells them only what they want to hear. The real world has an abundance of possible interactions with a diverse range of views, experiences, lessons and interests. Interactions that should be open-minded, non judgemental, enlightening and educational. Folks can agree or disagree with other folks. But should always agree to disagree within the filter of civility and with respect."
"With all due respect, blacks are 13% of the population. How can they expect to have equity in being represented in a majority white population in films the majority wants to watch? Yes their stories are worth telling but how can the black population be expected to bring them up to equity with the majority who make films for whites? They are depending on fellow blacks to support their success and it isn't working."

Great publicity for Issa Rae and her financiers
The history of America and the lack of empathy is directly related to the type of influence/ stereotype that black ppl are encouraged to play in the industry. We don’t demand more for ourselves.
Then BW should stop acting like this then. Or continue to be portrayed that way
This is very ignorant
I like Rochelle from everybody hates Chris doe ✋🏾💀
"Candice Owens is black she’s what you like and prefer then, an intelligent bright woman. white, brown woman are all portrayed certain ways too. Quit the nonsense all people all colours had slavery it was what everyone did. Africans sold and bought their own people. In Africa they wear white face are white face. Everyone needs to stop obsessing over your race we all gotta stop talking about it. White people are no more racist than you guys in this day and age. BLM is the THE most anti white racism thing Eva known in recent decades. Let’s all just be ‘people’ forget what pigment we are."
Candice Owens is a buffoon and even she knows it
"I am glad I am not a tv watcher or Hollywood follower. How I see black woman, they are in ballet, ice skating and forensic science and many more brilliant occupations. Check them out, they are amazing!"
"personally, I do agree with the problems that these stereotypes bring, but i also think that the strong black woman trope is also problematic in some aspects and its tropes like these that bring misrepresentation towards non Caucasians in general and that's the problem we need to address."
Soooo.Why are black women so angry again. Lol no accountability.
"They're mad because white people have reduced their identity to stereotypes? I don't think they ever stopped being mad, they just had to act like they weren't. Please try to understand, there's a whole video about why they're mad. Did you just not listen and clicked onto the video so you could make a comment? Could you give me any evidence (articles, ect) as to why black women shouldn't be angry about how they're treated? Can you tell me that they have it better than others (give me examples) and therefore they shouldn't be upset? I'm not telling you to shut up, I'm telling you to speak up. I'd love to have the opportunity to talk to you about your views. In fact, I'm taking a college course in Arguing and Convincing, and would be grateful if you would engage in debate with me. No name calling, fallacies, bias, or emotional influence on facts, just a rational conversation between two people with a differing opinion on a certain subject. The ball is in your court good sir! Let us commence! :D"
Well... these stereotypes are consistent with what is showed on the social media
They forgot the tragic mulattp
What about the mix girl
"She’s a different trope, more on the soft feminine side…"
I do believe that stories need to be told by the people who experience and live that particular lifestyle. It is important for the audience to see the truth. Hopefully the audience will be less hateful and dismissive of the black perspective of life.. I see a lot of people primarily white people and many people of color that do not identify as black talk about how black people need to be trained. That has been so degrading and insulting to here. I believe that everyone should be entitled to their own personality. I am a mixed woman who has looked towards the media for representation some show's did a great job representing black women of all skin tones. But I have seen many show's that did not represent black women well and actually made a joke out of black women. Which was very hurtful to see. I love being black and mixed. 💙💚💜🤎🖤🤍
"In America Black women abort 38% of their babies over half in NYC. 80% are obese, 76% fatherless children, most in debt and only 25% will ever marry. The Black woman must take accountability. If you really want to know about Black History check out THE NEGRO PROJECT from the Democrats."

"I love my sister's I LOVE that brown skin, I love that smooth golden melanin. I love that thick collagen. I love the curly soft but not stringy hair between my fingers. I love the strong personality. The passion. The heart that they don't give to just anyone but once they let you in it. I love the REALNESS not the fake smile in your face but stab you behind your back. I love the similar experiences and the similar backgrounds that makes them so relatable. I love the history that we share. I love the way they move their bodies, their rhythm is magical. I love how they have kept their heads up through all the oppression they have endured. I don't hate white women. I just LOVE black women, my Queens."
You black females love acting like what you see on TV
"Don't white people too? Is there any child who hasn't enjoyed pretending to be their favorite superhero or character from a book? The difference is that white people get cool examples to look up to, but black people only get stereotypes and one dimensional cardboard cutouts to mimic. Of course it makes them uncomfortable and unhappy, imagine if every white character either acted like Tony Stark, Fizzik (from the princess bride), Regina George (from Mean Girls), Harley Quinn before her character development, or Pearl (from Steven Universe) in the first season. Also, before you can use the ad hominem circumstantial fallacy, I'm not black. I just think black women shouldn't be represented by stupid characters and then the studio gets to claim to be a champion for diverse rights."

A few rich Arab households have been discovered to have enslaved from Africa working as maids nannies and cooks . Unpaid . and treated cruelly Probably sold by a close family member .What is wrong with THAT side of the family ? we all know that Arabs was one of the races black men after created in the old testament times . In those days women were stoned and excommunicated for adultery being a bad wife etc .
What's...your point? I'm confused. Did you just throw in emotion provoking language and not even make a conclusion??
Nobody in the hood cares about Black slaves somewhere else.
It is what it is.we spend way to much time being entertained.
I'd like it if black women had enough self-confidence real self confidence the type where you give up on God's laws and morality and given to the one of many of Satan's lies strong black woman is a lie strong black woman don't wear weave and cumbrellas /eyelashes makeup etc. A attractive black natural woman that finds her look and confident in it. Also None aggressive non-combative lady like and soft spoken. Would take two tame and keep a black man. Only if our women would understand this men would trust them enough to give them the world. Don't want to help build up black men. They bought into the lie that they want bad boy's and when they decided to believe that they created a bunch of bad boys. Our young men and women the children gangsters the rap culture is feeding us our narrative. We used to have a family structure GOD Father Mother Children. Satan play games with us with our minds and our emotions he turned everything upside down. Along with these satanists. We are living in his lie the world.

"@@dudleymilbin5599 I just said you sounded like you were one the verge of doing something drastic. You went on a rant about how women should know their place and that I would know what was wrong ""real soon"". Your ""family values"" (God, Father, Mother, Children), while noble in concept, can validate abuse because if someone complains about anything, they will be shamed for not conforming to the structure. It shames people for trying to communicate and cooperate in a family dynamic. Plus your whole speech sounds EXACTLY like what a cult in my state preaches and how they trap people into their community. The cult calls themselves Christians, but they take their views to the extremes and use the word of God as a weapon to frighten and beat people into compliance and cooperation. They use the excuse of the father being above the mother to control women. They use the excuse of parents being above the children to justify abuse. They raise people to think that if they got hurt, they must have done something wrong and God had abandoned them to punish them. Everything they don't agree with, they insist that the devil is at fault. They don't like girls wearing shorts, so they say that the devil is at work instead of admitting that a girl might just like to wear shorts with no motives other than they thought it looked nice. They don't like makeup, so they say that the devil is at work and people who wear makeup are hiding their God given glory, which is a sin (if God really meant for only natural looks, why are we wearing clothes? All the arguments against makeup can also be used for clothes). They say all kinds of things are because of Satan and people are just too frightened and brainwashed to question it.

Why is no one calling out the black women who play these roles we are literally doing this to ourselves🤔😑
"no we don’t. white women and asian women that are “sassy” never have that stereotype attached to their RACE. and moretime we’re not even aggressive, we are provoked and then demonised for our very normal reaction towards the aggressor. like stop tryna put the blame on us bc even if we were perfect they’d still exist"

"I think it's because many roles are biographical, like in the help and even in everybody hates Chris, the story is not about them, so they don't have a lot of depth, but also that's how they where in the biographic eyes of the lyrical self. I think the real problem is when that is the only type off representation you get, like all women were like this."
All of them ack like DMX. To me
"I recently spent a couple of weeks just watching television with women in them, some movies too, before I noticed there were no dark-skinned women with kinky hair, oh, there were some, but they had to wear a straight-haired wig."
"Black women should be angry. They should be apoplectic, given the enduring BS. The people that are paid to perpetuate the stereotypes do so knowing there is nothing to fear from their 'community.'"
WAIT ARE YOU SAYING BLACK WOMEN SHOULD ATTACK ACTORS?!! Dude what?? Are you saying people SHOULD fear their own community?
A lot of these comments are so disappointing. Just because one is pointing about issues about one thing doesn’t mean that you have to compare it to something else especially of another races’. Those issues can coexist. How annoying.
"When Black people point out what Black people gotta change it's always ""what about them over there?"" We all know the Jezebel plagues every community of people but the Sapphire and Mammy trope has dug its nails and controlled the brains of the Black American community. Low-key I believe it's time to abandon the ones who don't get it. P.S. the small hat tribe had a hand in most of the caricatures that plague Black people."
The last quote is a WHOLE MOOD!! Why can't white viewers find their humanity in our stories? in BIPOC stories? Why are we expected to find our humanity in their stories and no one else's???

"Everyday I find new reasons that I am glad I never aimed to join mainstream media for singing or acting, and that is sad and true. Everyday, I am glad that I use my spoken and written words well and for positivity more often than not. I have always had a passion for fashion and this sits well with me. I can have differing fashions ideas; whereas it seems there would be limited 'Negative' screen characters. If I were to do music, it would be with a specific contract for clean non-degrading uplifting music. I am glad I am from the UK, though Black characters/musicians in mainstream media have a short shelf life, there is more room for less degrading Black stereotypes. If I were to be interested in music especially, I may prefer the independent route as I am of the understanding that one can have and maintain more creative control. I did used to write scripts/screenplays in my youth and would welcome sponsorship for a positive film regarding Black lives as I have been itching to write a mini series, trilogy, something lately. Envy not wherever feasible, however credit for positive Black produce and productivity or showings is a must. P.E.A.C.E"

Latino women are in an even better position but it’s the same thing for them. The blacker looking ones line Cardi B are not considered as beautiful as a JLO or Shakira. That is why the blacker looking Hispanics date black men because they are considered more a prize among black men and are not among Latino men."

It true. You can't deny it
Question for all why do you care at all about the portrayal of one group to another what difference does it make in your life? How does it affect your life? Does it affected in a way that's life-changing and important way? What's the reason for caring? Those are good questions to answer. Does someone like the queen of England spend all their life worrying about how they are portrayed in EXAGGERATED ABD FALSE terms? IF THEY DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT DON'T YOU?
The reason it becomes an issue because your everyday life can be changed by someone who has only seen hood movies. It can create the perception that all black women are loud and rude. Or that all black women only worship white people and care nothing for themselves. On the flip side having youth only seeing these black people in their everyday media and life can cause(without proper guidance) to idolize those negative behaviors which create more problems down the lane. Also a lot of the movies are not resolved in a way that shows these behavior patterns to be negative. Negativity usually ends up saving the day or being the final scene. It's a lot.
"@@tkeyahhines-davis7480 well your point is understandable and well taken. I think you need to relax to a degree and recognize that if you keep life simple and your goals simple that your life really isn't going to change that much by taking the attitude of what do I really need in life? if you need respect then act respectful and hang around respectable people, if you need love be loving and hang around loving people if you need a place to live more than likely you'll be able to get one and a job and if you have these things in your life how is your life going to be changed significantly its my point. It's when you start wanting more and more and more and more is that when you start feel like you're missing out and you mentioned yourself in your comment the need to have proper guidance, if you have proper guidance you don't have to worry as much about the influence of TV because hopefully you're limiting how much TV and negative images your child watches. And surely you know by now if you have any type of experience in life that haters are going to hate and no matter what images of betrayed on TV people are going to continue to pick the influences that appeal to their attitude culture and upbringing more than likely."

"Brain Gregory, you do realize that implicit bias is not just a thing in the media right? That implicit bias influences how people see other people. That these damaging stereotypes have been engraved into the minds and cultures of billions of people across the world, right? Often, when Black women travel to Europe and Asia, local men approach them asking for their ""price,"" assuming these tourists are prostitutes because movies and music videos have portrayed Black women as hypersexual and promiscuous. When Black women try to get jobs in corporations, they cannot show any form of anger or frustration lest they be told they are too aggressive or mean. So yes, we should care because most of the world may never personally interact with a Black woman but will hold these ideas in their head and pour them onto the Black people they encounter."

And now this is systemic racism..
"From the standpoint of image manipulation through film, it's worth noting how Sidney Poirtier's rise in popularity - an attractive cultured black man (To Sir with Love) - was quickly countered by the Shaft and SuperFly series which reinforced unfortunate stereotypes. The power of the moving image to influence culture is unprecedented in history and has yet to be openly discussed. There is so much money and, ultimately, power involved."

It's simply racism and anti-blackness. A big part of racism and racial stereotypes is taking a human trait that can be seen in people of all races and using it to demonize and generalize people of a certain race.
"I think it is because a lot of actresses portray angry black women on t.v. and in movies. When the public is constantly shown just one type of personality they are eventually going to see most black women as this way and not have much tolerance for their behavior whether justified or not.

Are certain types of music not forms of art because the content is degrading or contains stereotypes? I don't claim to know how Williams felt about his work, but I don't think it's as simple as saying it wasn't an art form."
"@@Neesi392: You're entitled to your opinion, but not your facts. The fact is, minstrel shows were wildly popular among *black* audiences. Not only did black men freely and willingly perform in them, but black audiences freely and willingly spent their hard-earned time and money to attend and be delighted in them. Because even when the country really was racist, people still knew how to laugh at stereotypes of themselves, and to distinguish between light-hearted entertainment and (say) the kind of demonization exhibited by ""Birth of a Nation."" Most American blacks today -- like most Americans generally -- are ignorant of American history, more or less buy into the narrative that all of history before the 1970s or 80s was all-racism-all-the-time, have zero appreciation for the complexity of American race relations and the salutary developments that occured therein over the course of some two centuries -- the way BLM and leftist Democrats tell this history, the Civil Rights Act evidently spontaneously generated out of nowhere, and utterly inexplicably -- and so naturally the nuances of this history are lost.

"@@Neesi392 Real black-face has been non-existent in the U.S. for decades now. What's often called ""black face"" by the race-hustlers is nothing of the sort, at least not by any historic definition of the word. Just about all the examples people ever bring up are special situations that have nothing to do with perpetuating racist tropes at all -- and, more often than not, are actually criticizing those tropes or making fun of them. See, for example, the supposed instance of ""blackface"" in a Golden Girls episode.
