This is Matilda, a 24 year old African Grey female parrot. She had never been to a vet prior to coming into our rescue. Every bird that comes to us is given a wellness exam, that includes a thorough examination by our amazing avian veterinarian, Dr. Todd Driggers, owner of Avian and Exotics Animal Clinic of Arizona. After this procedure, Matilda is breathing much better and has avoided any complications. Although it isn't a painful procedure, it is uncomfortable. She's doing fine now! Rhinolith is a nose stone caused by accumulation of the debris like blood, nasal discharge or dust in the nostrils. Other causes can be vitamin A deficiency or infections like viral, bacterial or fungal. It is critical to have your avian vet check your bird's nasal sinus cavity every time you take your bird in for any exam. Hopefully, your bird has a wellness exam at least once a year.",,15,"Pets & Animals","Lifestyle_(sociology),Pet",PT1M26S,86,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,4071429,14219,,0,617

""Laboratory Conditions"" by Jocelyn Stamat Starring Marisa Tomei, Minnie Driver, and Paulo Costanzo Connect with the Filmmaker: http://www.wordplayer.com https://www.joerussellproductions.com/ https://www.tiktok.com/@hollywoodjoerussell More About ""Laboratory Conditions"": At a hospital, late one night, a physician discovers that one of her patients is missing, and likely has passed away, as he was not expected to survive the night. The physician tracks the body to a nearby medical school, where students are in the midst of an illicit experiment. The physician faces an ethical dilemma that puts her clinical judgment up against the amoral ambition of the chair of the graduate school of neuroscience. Even if the doctor can save her patient, what about the next one? And the one after that? At what point should human compassion outweigh research science and “the need to know”?

I was product shopping and I bought these products. In this video you see me try them out. This video is not sponsored and my opinion on these products it's completely true. Don't forget to Subscribe to my channel. Let me know if you would try these products. ALL three of these were R65 each at Clicks. The curl definer is amazing. My curls were instantly defined and that's never happened to me. So you will be seeing more hairstyles with that Gel. The mask, my scalp loved every second in that mask and my hair is till Moisturises until now. It honestly felt natural like I made my own mask. The butter is really thick but it stayed in my hair for days. It was hard to shake off the whiteness for like 24hours. It took like 7 hours for my hair to dry. I have a heavy hand 😂😂I use alot of product. Don't be like me.

It's a simple, catchy tune that children love to sing along to. In fact, it's so popular that it has been used in various forms of media, from TV shows to memes. Recently, the song gained popularity again when it was performed on Ohio's Got Talent. The performance was so impressive that it sparked a wave of ""one two buckle my shoe"" memes online. People have been creating their own versions of the song, like ""1 2 buckle my shoe 3 4 buckle some more 5 6 Nike kicks,"" and sharing them on social media. These memes have even turned into a ""one two buckle my shoe song meme"" trend. It's clear that this old nursery rhyme still has the power to entertain and bring people together in a fun way.

By tuning into my YouTube channel, you willl benefit tips on taking care of your 4b/4c hair. You'll see how i style and manipulate my stubborn natural hair. You will also see my favorite protective styles and me trying to do them myself(we'll just have to see how that goes)and me exploring new styles as well. You will also see me being human like everyone else with a dash of introverted,quirky and weird spices of course.
