Don't forget to Subscribe to my channel. Let me know if you would try these products. ALL three of these were R65 each at Clicks. The curl definer is amazing. My curls were instantly defined and that's never happened to me. So you will be seeing more hairstyles with that Gel. The mask, my scalp loved every second in that mask and my hair is till Moisturises until now. It honestly felt natural like I made my own mask. The butter is really thick but it stayed in my hair for days. It was hard to shake off the whiteness for like 24hours. It took like 7 hours for my hair to dry.

People pointed out on social media that this is not the first time the company has used prejudicial advertisements which are insulting to black communities. The EFF has also weighed in and issued a call for Clicks to close all its stores.

Nonkululeko Gobodo, an independent, non-executive director at the Clicks Group, says the controversial hair advert is both unacceptable and inexcusable. The online advert denigrated the hair of black people, portraying white hair as normal. Amid protests by the EFF, the lifestyle and health retailer has closed all stores today and will re-open them tomorrow in order to offer counselling services to staff. Gobodo says she has highlighted the issue with Clicks management asking it to review the processes used to approve the advert. She also says racism and prejudice against women are crimes, and the country cannot move forward unless these are immediately addressed in society and business.

There has been an outrage on how offensive the campaign is to black people. This brings under the spotlight the approval processes of adverts that border on racial lines and how their messages can be conveyed without being offensive. EFF leader, Julius Malema says the apology by Clicks must be accompanied by justice. He's outlined the party's demands for Clicks stores saying corrective steps need to be taken over a controversial online advertisement. Joining us now is Nomazibulo Tshanga, an HR specialist and founder of Ziyana Business Consulting and Training.
